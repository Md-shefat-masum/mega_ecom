Curved panels also help with gameplay immersion, making you feel more connected to the entire experience. Optix G27CQ4 curved gaming monitor features a 27\" WQHD panel that supports resolution up to 2560x1440. This 16:9 panel allows gamers to examine bigger game scenes compared to other traditional FHD panels and put them ahead of other competitors. Such resolution also allows gamers to multitask with several windows displayed at the same time, providing the efficiency for them to achieve everything they want. Optix monitors are equipped with a 165Hz refresh rate + 1ms response time VA LED panel which has the most benefit in fast-moving game genres such as first-person shooters, fighters, racing sims, real-time strategy, and sports. These types of games require very fast and precise movements, and an ultra-high refresh rate and fast response time monitor will put you ahead of your competition. Generic monitor displays normally have a flicker rate of about 200-times per second, which is unnoticeable to the naked eye but can cause fatigue over time. MSI Anti-Flicker technology provides a very comfortable viewing experience by reducing the amount of flicker. Optix monitors are optimized to produce less amount of blue light displayed by the monitor so that you can game for longer periods of time without eye fatigue. By having a large viewing angle, MSI gaming monitors has more leeway for placing your monitor in your setup without giving up the optimal viewing experience.
