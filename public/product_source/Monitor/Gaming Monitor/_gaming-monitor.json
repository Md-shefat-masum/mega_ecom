You'll experience amazingly-fluid gaming visuals, giving you the upper hand in first-person shooters, racing, real-time strategy and sports titles. ASUS Fast IPS Display allows the display's liquid crystal elements to switch up to 4X faster than conventional IPS panels for improved response. With a 1 ms gray-to-gray response time, smearing and motion blur are virtually eliminated. This display also delivers superior images with outstanding colors thanks to DCI-P3 95% color gamut and an astounding 1,000:1 contrast ratio. Wide 178-degree viewing angles ensure minimal distortion and color shift even when you're viewing from extreme positions. With variable-refresh-rate (VRR) technology enabled by default, you're assured seamless, tear-free gaming experiences from your NVIDIA GeForce GTX 10 or NVIDIA GeForce RTX 20-series graphics card. With ELMB SYNC, you can enable ELMB (low-motion-blur technology) and Adaptive-sync at the same time, eliminating ghosting and tearing for sharp visuals and high frame rates while gaming. HDR technology delivers a wider color range and higher contrast than traditional monitors. The brightest whites and the darkest blacks bring out details like never before. The display is also capable of 400 cd/m2, meeting the stringent requirements for DisplayHDR 400 certification. ASUS Dynamic Shadow Boost technology automatically clarifies dark areas of the game world with optimizing other areas, improving overall viewing while also making it easier to spot enemies hidden in shaded areas of the map. The ASUS-exclusive, integrated GamePlus hotkey offers in-game enhancements that help you get more out of your game. This function is co-developed with input from pro gamers, allowing them to practice and improve their gaming skills. ASUS GameVisual Technology has seven pre-set display modes to optimize visuals for different types of content. This unique feature can be easily accessed through a hotkey or the on-screen display settings menu. Flicker-Free technology reduces flicker to minimize eyestrain for improved comfort when you're embroiled in long gaming sessions. ASUS Ultra-Low Blue Light technology reduces the amount of potentially harmful blue light emitted by the display.
