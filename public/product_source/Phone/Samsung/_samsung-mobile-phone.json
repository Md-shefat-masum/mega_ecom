The&nbsp; Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G comes with improvements and upgrades in display, performance, and camera section based on fans' demands. The Galaxy S21 Fan Edition is exclusively available as a 5G version with a revision in the following sections.</p><h3>120Hz Smooth Experience with 6.4\" FHD+Dynamic AMOLED Display</h3><p>The Galaxy S21 FE 5G has everything you want in 6.4 inches, making it ideal for connecting with friends, discovering new interests, going live, and binge-watching your favorite shows. With Super Smooth 120Hz, this smartphone has the smoothest scrolling screen. You can experience quick touch responses in game mode, and it optimizes the refresh rate to smooth out your feed. You also get extra protection for your Galaxy S21 FE 5G thanks to the Corning Gorilla Glass Victus.</p><h3>Triple Rear Camera Set-up and 32MP Selfie Camera</h3><p>The Galaxy S21 FE 5G has a 12MP primary camera, a secondary 12MP camera for ultrawide shots, and an 8MP tele for 3x optical zoom. The selfie camera, which is likely to be 32MP, is also the same. Your features are highlighted and refined so that you look your best on all of your social media platforms. This phone has improved image processing and cool features, which are made possible by the new chipset. It allows you to switch between cameras while filming or capture the action in a single take for instant upload-ready footage. With the 30X Space Zoom on the Galaxy S21 FE 5G, you can capture that sideline shot from the back of the bleachers. You can also use Zoom Lock to reduce shakiness as you zoom in further.</p><h3>Fan-favorite Features</h3><p>The Galaxy S21 FE 5G includes stereo speakers and an optical fingerprint scanner under the display. However, the microSD slot was omitted. One of these fan-favorite features will not be well received by the community.&nbsp; It offers Hyperfast 5G, so you can share photos and videos in a flash. Instead of a virtual proximity sensor, the S21 FE 5G now has a physical one.&nbsp;The Infinity-O Display helps reduce harmful blue light at night so you can binge your favorite shows comfortably.</p><h3>Super Fast Charging and Wireless Powershare</h3><p>Even on 5G, the day will last longer thanks to the 4500mAh battery's cooperation with an energy-efficient display and processor. When you've got a low battery and no time to wait, you can get hours of power with only minutes of charging. Thanks to Fast Wireless Charging 2.0 you can get a speedy power-up without needing to plug in. You can use your Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G to charge your buds, watch, or even a friend's phone.<br></p><h3>IP68-rated for Dust and Water Resistance</h3><p>The Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G is IP68-rated for dust and water resistance, which is an important feature of the Galaxy S series. Its design is similar to that of the other Galaxy S21 phones. The front of the Smartphone is made of Gorilla Glass Victus, the frame is made of aluminum, and the back is made of matte plastic. The waterproof design keeps your phone safe from slashes, drips, and up to 1.5 meters of water for around 30 minutes.</p><h2>Buy Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G from the best Mobile Phone Shop in Bangladesh: Star Tech</h2><p>In Bangladesh, you can get the original <a href=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-5g\" target=\"\">Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G</a> From Star Tech.
