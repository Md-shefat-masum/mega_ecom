A 6.7-inch Super Retina XDR display with all-screen OLED technology is a feature of the iPhone 15 Pro Max. It has adjustable refresh rates up to 120 Hz, ProMotion technology, and 460 ppi resolution at 2796 by 1300 pixels. With an average maximum brightness of 1,000 nits, the display boasts an impressive peak brightness of 2,000 nits for outdoor use, as well as a peak HDR brightness of 1,600 nits. With its state-of-the-art 3nm processor, this phone offers unmatched performance. With its cutting-edge features, the ultimate camera system delivers amazing photos and videos. Its efficient battery with Type-C charging promises ease, and its high-resolution display provides a visual feast. The <strong>Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max</strong> is without a doubt the greatest phone released to date and the pinnacle of smartphone innovation. A few of the features include an oleophobic layer that deters fingerprints, Dynamic Island, Always-On display, True Tone technology, support for broad color (P3), Haptic Touch, and an incredible contrast ratio of 20,00,000:1 (typical). It also makes it possible to display multiple languages and characters at once. Use a USB-C to Wi-Fi 6E connection for better data transmission speeds and wireless rates.</p><h3>Developed in Titanium</h3><p>The titanium bands of the <strong>iPhone 15 Pro Max</strong> have a gorgeous, fine-brushed surface obtained through precision machining, sanding, brushing, and blasting. New curved edges and the narrowest boundaries on the iPhone make it even more comfortable to handle. The titanium band is attached to a new internal aluminum frame via solid-state diffusion. This industry-first breakthrough uses a thermomechanical method to combine two metals with extraordinary strength. The inside frame is also comprised of 100% recycled aluminum, which adds to our overall use of recycled materials and helps us achieve our 2030 climate targets.</p><h3>Super Retina XDR Display with ProMotion</h3><p>With ProMotion, the <strong>iPhone 15 Pro Max</strong>&nbsp;features an innovative Super Retina XDR display. When you require the best graphics performance possible, it increases refresh rates to 120Hz. When you don't, it ramps down to conserve electricity. With StandBy, your iPhone may become a new full-screen device with information that is visible to you even while you're far away. To see the clock, highlight your most beloved pictures, or monitor your widgets, simply turn it sideways while it charges. It remains constant because of the Always-On display. However, you may easily sleep at night because the screen dims.</p><h3>Dynamic Island</h3><p>Alerts and Live Activities are bubbled up by Dynamic Island so you won't miss them when you're engaged in other activities. Sports scores, flight status, your upcoming ride, and much more can all be readily tracked with your <strong>Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max</strong>. You don't need to tap your Lock Screen to be informed because of the Always-On display, which keeps it glanceable. The iPhone uses sophisticated algorithms to determine whether it is facedown or in your pocket and turns off to conserve battery life.</p><h3>All‑New Action Button</h3><p>Fast track to your favorite feature with the all-new Action button. To start the action after you've selected the desired one, simply press and hold. Ring and silent modes are switched between by default on the <strong>iPhone 15 Pro Max</strong> with the new Action button. Selecting an alternative action allows you to automatically mute your iPhone using Focus filters or utilizing Control Center to mute it. The Action button is ready for whatever it is you're working on. To take a spontaneous selfie, launch the camera. Quickly record a voice memo. Not only can you play music and turn on the lights in your living room, but you can also use Shortcut to launch an app or perform a sequence of actions.</p><h3>Apple A17 Pro Chip</h3><p>With its whole new class of iPhone chips, the A17 Pro offers by far our strongest graphics performance. With more detailed locations and more lifelike characters, mobile games will have an immersive appearance and feel. A17 Pro picks up pace quickly and doesn't let up, with industry-leading efficiency and speed. The <strong>iPhone 15 Pro Max</strong> introduces hardware-accelerated ray tracing, which can achieve up to four times faster results than software-based ray tracing. This results in more realistic lighting and more fluid graphics. It is the smartphone with the fastest ray-tracing performance. By combining the power of the GPU and the Neural Engine, MetalFX Upscaling creates high-resolution graphics with far less power consumption.</p><h3>48MP Main Camera That Captures Wildest Imagination</h3><p>With its innovative quad-pixel sensor, which adjusts to the conditions of the shot, you can capture incredibly detailed low-light photographs while making the most of 48 megapixels. Additionally, it allows you to zoom in closer with a 2x Telephoto. The new Photonic Engine combines an optimal image for light capture with the best pixels from an ultra-high-resolution picture. For everyday images with more detail, you now immediately receive 24MP photos, which is twice the resolution of the previous version. With 48MP HEIF, you may get four times the resolution in a shareable format. Alternatively, for exact control over color, detail, and dynamic range, shoot in 48MP ProRAW. You can now select between the 24 mm, 28 mm, or 35 mm default main camera lens without carrying additional equipment. That is computational photography's power. The ACES Academy Color Encoding System, a global color standard for big motion picture productions, is supported for the first time on the <strong>iPhone 15 Pro Max</strong>. Directors, do what you do best. Create immersive experiences with spatial videos. With the help of the sophisticated Ultra Wide and Main cameras on the iPhone 15 Pro, you can record 3D recordings and watch your best moments again with Apple Vision Pro.</p><h3>USB‑C Connector &amp; Up To 20x Faster Wi-Fi 6E</h3><p>With USB-C&nbsp;connectivity, the iPhone 15 Pro Max is the first iPhone to offer significantly quicker data transfer rates and more efficient professional workflows than ever before. With the new USB-C connector, you can use the same cable to charge your <strong>iPhone 15 Pro Max</strong> and your Mac or iPad. It is now possible to connect USB-C devices, such as microphones, fast external storage, 4K displays, and thumb drives. Moreover, you may use your iPhone to charge your Apple Watch or AirPods. With the additional 20W USB-C Power Adapter, you can charge your device to 50% capacity in around 30 minutes. Send cable clutter packing. Additionally, you'll enjoy twice as fast wireless speeds with the brand-new WiFi 6E. With a significant speed bump, Wi-Fi 6E offers you the fastest Wi-Fi on your iPhone, enabling you to upload, download, and transfer files quickly.</p><h2><span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit;\">Buy </span>iPhone 15 Pro Max 1TB Natural Titanium (Singapore)<span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit;\"> from Star Tech</span><br></h2><p>In Bangladesh, you can get the original&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">iPhone 15 Pro Max 1TB Natural Titanium (Singapore)</span>&nbsp;From Star Tech.
