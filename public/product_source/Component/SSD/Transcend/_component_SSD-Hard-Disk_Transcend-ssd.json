Featuring the SATA III 6Gb/s interface, DDR3 DRAM cache, enhanced firmware algorithms, and built with high-quality NAND flash, the ultra-compact M.2 SSD 832S delivers high performance and peerless reliability. Unlike the existing planar NAND chips, 3D NAND flash is a type of flash memory in which the memory cells are stacked vertically in multiple layers. 3D NAND is developed to break through density limitations of the 2D planar NAND, and thus can deliver a greater level of performance and endurance. Compliant with M.2 form factor Type 2280, Transcend's 3D NAND M.2 SSD 832S is just 80mm in length and comes in a single-sided layout - meaning that only one side of the SSD has components attached to it - making the 832S the perfect solution for small form factor laptops and ultra-light PCs. The M.2 SSD 832S makes for an easy upgrade to your computer, taking up little space while giving it a much needed energy boost. Featuring the M.2 standard (80mm), the next generation SATA III 6Gb/s interface and a powerful controller, Transcend's M.2 SSD 832S reaches incredible read and write speeds of up to 560MB/s and 500MB/s. When used as a cache, the M.2 SSD 832S provides 1.5 times faster boot time than conventional hard drives. Dedicated to maximizing high-performance computing, the M.2 SSD 832S features 4k random file read and write speeds up to 85,000 IOPS that deliver incredibly short loading times and almost instant response for heavy graphics and multimedia applications. The M.2 form factor enables expansion and integration of functions onto a single form factor module solution. M.2 SSDs include a smaller form factor but with larger capacities than that of mSATA and half-slim SSDs. With its singled-sided M.2 form factor, the SSD 832S is even slimmer and offers better compatibility. <br></p>","specifications":[{"heading":"Key Features","values":[{"key":"Capacity","value":"256GB"},{"key":"Form Factor","value":"M.2"},{"key":"Flash Type","value":"3D NAND"},{"key":"Interface","value":"SATA III 6Gb/s"},{"key":"Sequential R/W","value":"Read: 530 MB/s"},{"key":"MTBF","value":"2,000,000 hour(s)"}]},{"heading":"Physical Specification","values":[{"key":"Dimension","value":"80.0 mm x 22.0 mm x 2.23 mm"},{"key":"Weight","value":"9 g"}]},{"heading":"Temperature","values":[{"key":"Operating Temperature","value":"0°C (32°F) ~ 70°C (158°F)"}]},{"heading":"Warranty","values":[{"key":"Manufacturing Warranty","value":"03 years"}]}],"latest_price":{},"images":["https://www.startech.com.bd/image/cache/catalog/ssd/transcend/832s/832s-01-500x500.jpg","https://www.startech.com.bd/image/cache/catalog/ssd/transcend/832s/832s-6-500x500.jpg","https://www.startech.com.bd/image/cache/catalog/ssd/transcend/832s/832s-5-500x500.jpg"],"product_seo_title":"Transcend 832S 256GB SATAIII SSD Price in Bangladesh","product_seo_description":"Buy Transcend 832S 256GB M.2 2280 SATAIII SSD at best & lowest price in Bangladesh.

Featuring the SATA III 6Gb/s interface, DDR3 DRAM cache, enhanced firmware algorithms, and built with high-quality NAND flash, the ultra-compact M.2 SSD 832S delivers high performance and peerless reliability. Unlike the existing planar NAND chips, 3D NAND flash is a type of flash memory in which the memory cells are stacked vertically in multiple layers. 3D NAND is developed to break through density limitations of the 2D planar NAND, and thus can deliver a greater level of performance and endurance. Compliant with M.2 form factor Type 2280, Transcend's 3D NAND M.2 SSD 832S is just 80mm in length and comes in a single-sided layout - meaning that only one side of the SSD has components attached to it - making the 832S the perfect solution for small form factor laptops and ultra-light PCs. The M.2 SSD 832S makes for an easy upgrade to your computer, taking up little space while giving it a much needed energy boost. Featuring the M.2 standard (80mm), the next generation SATA III 6Gb/s interface and a powerful controller, Transcend's M.2 SSD 832S reaches incredible read and write speeds of up to 560MB/s and 500MB/s. When used as a cache, the M.2 SSD 832S provides 1.5 times faster boot time than conventional hard drives. Dedicated to maximizing high-performance computing, the M.2 SSD 832S features 4k random file read and write speeds up to 85,000 IOPS that deliver incredibly short loading times and almost instant response for heavy graphics and multimedia applications. The M.2 form factor enables expansion and integration of functions onto a single form factor module solution. M.2 SSDs include a smaller form factor but with larger capacities than that of mSATA and half-slim SSDs. With its singled-sided M.2 form factor, the SSD 832S is even slimmer and offers better compatibility. Despite its extra-small dimensions, the M.2 SSD 832S boasts a DDR3 DRAM cache and contains advanced features to enhance the performance of the SSD. Transcend SSD Scope is advanced, user-friendly software that makes it easy to ensure your Transcend SSD remains healthy, and continues to run fast and error-free by determining the condition and optimizing the performance of your drive.

Its 8-channel controller provides sequential R/W speeds of up to 7,200/6,200 MB/s and IOPS speeds of up to 530K, giving breathtaking performance and reaction time for desktops and laptops like none before. The PCIe SSD 250S boasts unrivaled performance, low latency, and great stability for sophisticated video editors, gamers, and software engineers, in addition to rapid speeds. The PCIe SSD 250S, with its PCI Express Gen 4 x4 interface, 3D NAND flash, 8-channel controller, and DRAM cache is ready to put brilliance in your hands. The PCIe SSD 250S supports the latest PCIe 4.0 standard. It has a bandwidth of 16 GT/s per lane, compared to PCIe 3.0's 8 GT/s per lane. PCIe 4.0, which is backward compatible with PCIe 3.0, allows your computer to run faster and has lower system latency. This implies a more smooth and more immersive experience for content developers and players! The PCIe SSD 250S has an ultra-thin graphene heatsink to efficiently increase the compact-sized SSD's heat dissipation. Graphene's strong conductivity quickly cools the system, guaranteeing steady device performance. To keep data secure, Transcend's PCIe SSD 250S is designed using LDPC (Low-Density Parity Check) coding, a sophisticated ECC technique. The temperature is accurately monitored and regulated for the PCIe SSD 250S, which is engineered with a dynamic thermal throttling mechanism, giving improved durability and stability for high-end applications. The Transcend 250S 1TB M.2 2280 1TB SSD comes with a 05-year warranty.</p>","specifications":[{"heading":"Key Features","values":[{"key":"Capacity","value":"1TB"},{"key":"Form Factor","value":"M.2 2280"},{"key":"Flash Type","value":"3D NAND flash"},{"key":"Interface","value":"NVMe PCIe Gen4 x4"},{"key":"Sequential R/W","value":"Read Speed (Max.) 7,200 MB/s"},{"key":"MTBF","value":"3,000,000 hour(s)"}]},{"heading":"Physical Specification","values":[{"key":"Dimension","value":"Double-sided 80 mm x 22 mm x 3.77 mm (3.15\" x 0.87\" x 0.15\")"},{"key":"Weight","value":"10 g (0.35 oz)"}]},{"heading":"Temperature","values":[{"key":"Operating Temperature","value":"0°C (32°F) ~ 70°C (158°F)"}]},{"heading":"Warranty","values":[{"key":"Manufacturing Warranty","value":"05 years"}]}],"latest_price":{"heading":"What is the price of Transcend 250S 1TB M.2 2280 SSD in Bangladesh?","paragraph":"The latest price of Transcend 250S 1TB M.2 2280 SSD in Bangladesh is 13,800৳.
