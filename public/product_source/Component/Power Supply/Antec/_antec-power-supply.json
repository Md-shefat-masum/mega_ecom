It is compatible with most electrical grids because it runs within the input range of 200-230V~, 6.3A, 50Hz. The power supply outputs are separated into many rails. The +3.3V and +5V rails may each supply up to 18A, while the +12V rail can supply a significant 62.5A. A total of 750W of output power is possible with the 0.3A and 2.5A offered by the +5Vsb and -12V rails, respectively. Because of its great operating efficiency and low energy consumption, this PSU has earned the 80 PLUS BRONZE certification. This certification lowers power expenses. Antec's CircuitShield technology provides industrial-grade protections that guarantee the safety and longevity of the connected components as well as the dependable 750W power supply Antec Atom B750. These protections include Over Voltage Protection (OVP), Under Voltage Protection (UVP), Short Circuit Protection (SCP), and Over Power Protection (OPP). The unit has a 120mm silent fan that maximizes heat dissipation while reducing noise when paired with the Thermal Manager, an intelligent fan control system. Flat cables improve airflow within the case and make cable management easier, which results in a build that is neater and more organized. Better overall performance and stability are achieved by the PSU using the Active Power Factor Correction (APFC), which lowers reactive power and increases efficiency. With these attributes, the Antec Atom B750 is a 750W power supply that is a trusted option for enthusiasts, professionals, and gamers who need a power supply that blends silent operation, efficiency, and safety.</p><h2>Buy Antec ATOM B750 750W 80 Plus Bronze Power Supply from Star Tech</h2><p>In Bangladesh, you can get original <strong>Antec ATOM B750 750W 80 Plus Bronze Power Supply</strong> From Star Tech.
