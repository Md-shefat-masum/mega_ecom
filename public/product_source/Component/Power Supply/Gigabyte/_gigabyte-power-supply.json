Installing only the cables you need to reduce clutter, to increase the airflow and to improve the chassis thermal performance. All capacitors are high quality Japanese capacitors, to produce the efficient performance and to ensure the longer reliability. Fan speed will be adjusted according to the system load. And the fan will stop when the system is idle or under low load (less than 20% load). The 2 ball bearing structure provides longer life time. 80 Plus Gold certified ensures to deliver 90% efficiency at 50% load. The better power efficiency leads to less power waste, less heat and less fan noise. And with the support of Intel processors, it will save more energy and more money. Single +12V rail provides the best power output, stability and compatibility for the hardware. It provides the easiest way to install the power cable. And it is the best design for overclocking. In order to make sure the entire computer system to operate stably under any conditions, we not only added protection designs such as OCP, OTP, OVP, OPP, UVP and SCP, but also ensured the stable operation of your system through the safety certification of various countries. <br></p>","specifications":[{"heading":"Key Features","values":[{"key":"Efficiency (Approx.)","value":"9‎0% at typical load"},{"key":"Certification","value":"80 PLUS Gold"},{"key":"Fan Size","value":"1‎35mm Double ball bearing fan"}]},{"heading":"Input","values":[{"key":"Voltage","value":"1‎00-240 Vac (full range)"},{"key":"Frequency Range","value":"4‎7-63 Hz"},{"key":"Current","value":"1‎0A"}]},{"heading":"Output","values":[{"key":"Modular Type","value":"Full Modular"},{"key":"Total Power","value":"750 Watts"}]},{"heading":"Connector","values":[{"key":"Main Power","value":"ATX/MB 20+4 Pin x 1 : 650mm"},{"key":"CPU","value":"CPU/EPS 4+4 Pin x 2 : 800mm*1 , 650mm*1"},{"key":"PCI-E","value":"PCI-e 6+2 Pin x 4 : 750mm*2 , 650mm+150mm*1"},{"key":"SATA","value":"SATA x6 + 4 Pin Peripheral x2 :"},{"key":"Molex","value":"4 Pin Peripheral x 3 + 4 pin Floppy x 1 : 450mm+100mm+100mm+100mm*1"},{"key":"Floppy","value":"4 Pin Floppy x 1 : 100mm"}]},{"heading":"Warranty Information","values":[{"key":"Manufacturing Warranty","value":"3 Years"}]}],"latest_price":{"heading":"What is the price of Gigabyte Aorus P750GM Power Supply in Bangladesh?","paragraph":"The latest price of Gigabyte Aorus P750GM Power Supply in Bangladesh is 9,800৳.
