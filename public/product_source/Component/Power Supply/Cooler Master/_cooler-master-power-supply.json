The efficiency rating indicates how much power is retained and/or lost when transferring it from the wall to your components. It does not indicate the overall quality of the PSU. A PSU doesnâ€™t need an 80 PLUS Gold rating to be safe and reliable. And a PSU with an 80 PLUS Gold rating isnâ€™t necessarily either of those things. The MWE White guarantees a typical efficiency of 85% while being both safe and reliable. The constant struggle between cooling and noise is as old as the consumer PC industry itself. Keeping your components cool without having to hear about it while you work is still one of the greatest challenges for all fan based cooling technologies. The MWE Whiteâ€™s solution to this problem is a thermally sensitive 120mm HDB fan. It spins based on the systemâ€™s temperature, constantly adjusting to keep your PSU running smoothly and safely with the minimum amount of noise required. Power comes in multiple voltage levels. The wall delivers power in one voltage level but your components each need a specific voltage to operate properly. The process of converting raw power from the wall to the multiple voltage levels your components need requires special components to complete this process quickly, efficiently, and safely. The MWE Whiteâ€™s DC-to-DC + LLC technology was painstakingly crafted to accomplish this goal. The Dual Forward circuit layout has been designed to convert 12V power to 3V and 5V levels with minimal ripple noise, 80 PLUS efficiency, and reduced risk to your connected components. For many PC Builders with aesthetics in mind, cabling can be on of the most troublesome parts of assembling a PC. Cables can be confusing, too short or too long, and they almost never look good. The MWE White uses flat and flexible black cables to help deal with these problems.

Cooler Master now reports Cybenetics noise and efficiency ratings for current power supply units where applicable. For more information about the Cybenetics rating system and their work with Cooler Master. The constant struggle between cooling and noise is as old as the consumer PC industry itself. Keeping your components cool without having to hear about it while you work is still one of the greatest challenges for all fan based cooling technologies. The MWE Whiteâ€™s solution to this problem is a thermally sensitive 120mm HDB fan. It spins based on the systemâ€™s temperature, constantly adjusting to keep your PSU running smoothly and safely with the minimum amount of noise required.  Getting power from the wall to the PSU and then to your components is a tricky situation. The power comes in one voltage level, but your components need a different one. That power has to first be transferred to/through a converter in order to make it safe for your parts to use without overloading. The lines/rails used to initially move power from the wall to the converter need to be reliable and consistent to ensure your systemâ€™s overall performance. Thatâ€™s why the MWE White only uses one +12V rail for this process. This way all the components in your system are constantly fed the same power from the same source in order to guarantee consistency between all connections. Power comes in multiple voltage levels. The wall delivers power in one voltage level but your components each need a specific voltage to operate properly.

The quiet 120mm fan, 80 PLUS White EU 230V efficiency, and 3 year warranty deliver a PSU that provides function and resilience you can count on. It's the perfect option for work horse systems stored and operated in less than ideal conditions and climates. This PSU has been engineered for reliability with a focus on reducing random shutdowns in conditions where power sources are inconsistent and unstable, making it ideal for locations prone to experience brown outs. The Elite - v4 is a complete solution, offering performance and stability at an affordable price.<br></p>\n<h3>ACTIVE PFC + FORWARD TOPOLOGY DESIGN<br></h3>\n<p>A power supply unit works by taking power directly from the wall or other fixed power source, converting it to the correct output required by the connected components, and then distributing that power to said components. If any part of this process is interrupted or executed poorly, the connected system components and the PSU itself could be damaged. Active PFC uses a circuit to correct power factor leading to reduced total harmonics, corrected AC input voltage, and increased overall efficiency output.<br></p>\n<h3>HIGH TEMPERATURE RESISTANCE<br></h3>\n<p>The new Elite - v4 has a maximum operating temperature of 40Â°C. That's at the level of many 80 Plus certified power supply units on the market today. This higher operating temperature allows you to power your system safely in warmer environments without having to worry about your system overheating or shutting off unexpectedly. The higher heat resistance also reduces temperature based wear, increasing the lifespan of the unit by a noticeable amount.<br></p>\n<h3>PEAK POWER TOLERANCE<br></h3>\n<p>This power supply unit can push out an additional 50W above maximum load for up to 10 seconds before turning off. This will allow your system a chance to save data and complete current processes in the event of output surge or overloading. While it may not be a feature you'll actively need all the time, it can be extremely useful in an emergency scenario.<br></p>\n<h3>80 PLUS WHITE EU 230V EFFICIENCY<br></h3>\n<p>The efficiency of your power supply unit is important because it directly affects your system's performance and your power bill. The efficiency rating does not reflect the quality or reliability of a PSU. It only reflects the unit's ability to move power from the wall to your components. The higher a PSU's efficiency is, the lower the total amount of power it needs to power your system.

The 80 PLUS Bronze efficiency rating, DC-to-DC + LLC circuit design, single +12V rail, active PFC, and temperature sensitive HDB fan offer a power supply unit that stays true to its original purpose. This PSU will handle all your core computing needs with none of the hassles or challenges of additional specialty features, software synchronization, or other bells and whistles. Just plug it into your system and get to work. For a great mid-tier computing experience, you can't go wrong with the MWE Bronze V2.<br></p>\n<h3>80 PLUS BRONZE CERTIFIED<br></h3>\n<p>It's important to understand what efficiency is and what the ratings actually mean. The efficiency rating indicates how much power is retained and/or lost when transferring it from the wall to your components. It does not indicate the overall quality of the PSU. A PSU doesn't need an 80 PLUS Gold rating to be safe and reliable. And a PSU with an 80 PLUS Gold rating isn't necessarily either of those things. The MWE Bronze V2 guarantees a typical efficiency of 85% while being both safe and reliable.<br></p>\n<h3>120MM HDB FAN<br></h3>\n<p>The constant struggle between cooling and noise is as old as the consumer PC industry itself. Keeping your components cool without having to hear about it while you work is still one of the greatest challenges for all fan based cooling technologies. The MWE Bronze's solution to this problem is a thermally sensitive 120mm HDB fan. It spins based on the system's temperature, constantly adjusting to keep your PSU running smoothly and safely with the minimum amount of noise required.<br></p>\n<h3>SINGLE +12V RAIL<br></h3>\n<p>Getting power from the wall to the PSU and then to your components is a tricky situation. The power comes in one voltage level, but your components need a different one. That power has to first be transferred to/through a converter in order to make it safe for your parts to use without overloading. The lines/rails used to initially move power from the wall to the converter need to be reliable and consistent to ensure your system's overall performance. That's why the MWE Bronze only uses one +12V rail for this process. This way all the components in your system are constantly fed the same power from the same source in order to guarantee consistency between all connections.<br></p>\n<h3>DC-TO-DC CIRCUIT DESIGN<br></h3>\n<p>Power comes in multiple voltage levels. The wall delivers power in one voltage level but your components each need a specific voltage to operate properly. The process of converting raw power from the wall to the multiple voltage levels your components need requires special components to complete this process quickly, efficiently, and safely. The MWE Bronze's DC-to-DC + LLC technology was painstakingly crafted to accomplish this goal. The Dual Forward circuit layout has been designed to convert 12V power to 3V and 5V levels with minimal ripple noise, 80 PLUS Bronze efficiency, and reduced risk to your connected components.<br></p>\n<h3>FLAT BLACK CABLES<br></h3>\n<p>For many PC Builders with aesthetics in mind, cabling can be one of the most troublesome parts of assembling a PC. Cables can be confusing, too short or too long, and they almost never look good. The MWE Bronze - V2 uses flat and flexible black cables to help deal with these problems. These cables are more discrete and flexible, making them easier to implement into your system while taking up less space. This is especially useful for smaller cases and preserving airflow.<br></p>","specifications":[{"heading":"Key Features","values":[{"key":"Efficiency (Approx.)","value":"88% Typically"},{"key":"Certification","value":"80 PLUS Bronze EU 230V"},{"key":"Fan Size","value":"120mm"}]},{"heading":"Input","values":[{"key":"Voltage","value":"200-240Vac"},{"key":"Frequency Range","value":"50-60Hz"},{"key":"Current","value":"8-4A"}]},{"heading":"Output","values":[{"key":"Modular Type","value":"Non-Moduler"},{"key":"Total Power","value":"450 Watts"},{"key":"AC Input","value":"200-240Vac"}]},{"heading":"Connector","values":[{"key":"Main Power","value":"ATX 24-PIN CONNECTORS x1"},{"key":"CPU","value":"EPS 4+4 PIN CONNECTORS x1"},{"key":"PCI-E","value":"PCI-E 6+2 PIN CONNECTORS x2"},{"key":"SATA","value":"SATA CONNECTORS x6"},{"key":"Molex","value":"PERIPHERAL 4-PIN CONNECTORS x3"}]},{"heading":"Warranty Information","values":[{"key":"Manufacturing Warranty","value":"5 Years"}]}],"latest_price":{"heading":"What is the price of Cooler Master MWE 450W V2 Power Supply in Bangladesh?","paragraph":"The latest price of Cooler Master MWE 450W V2 Power Supply in Bangladesh is 4,400৳.

The efficiency rating does not reflect the quality or reliability of a PSU. It only reflects the unitâ€™s ability to move power from the wall to your components. The higher a PSUâ€™s efficiency is, the lower the total amount of power it needs to power your system.

This is why itâ€™s important for a PSU to have the right protections and regulations to ensure this process runs correctly. The MWE Bronzeâ€™s Active Power Factor Correction uses a specialized circuit to correct power factor, leading to reduced total harmonics, corrected AC input voltage, and increased overall efficiency output.<br></p>\n<h3>120MM HDB FAN<br></h3>\n<p>The constant struggle between cooling and noise is as old as the consumer PC industry itself.

The 80 PLUS Bronze efficiency rating, DC-to-DC + LLC circuit design, single +12V rail, active PFC, and temperature sensitive HDB fan offer a power supply unit that stays true to its original purpose. This PSU will handle all your core computing needs with none of the hassles or challenges of additional specialty features, software synchronization, or other bells and whistles. Just plug it into your system and get to work. For a great mid-tier computing experience, you can't go wrong with the MWE Bronze V2. It's important to understand what efficiency is and what the ratings actually mean. The efficiency rating indicates how much power is retained and/or lost when transferring it from the wall to your components. It does not indicate the overall quality of the PSU. A PSU doesn't need an 80 PLUS Gold rating to be safe and reliable. And a PSU with an 80 PLUS Gold rating isn't necessarily either of those things. The MWE Bronze V2 guarantees a typical efficiency of 85% while being both safe and reliable. The constant struggle between cooling and noise is as old as the consumer PC industry itself. Keeping your components cool without having to hear about it while you work is still one of the greatest challenges for all fan based cooling technologies. The MWE Bronze's solution to this problem is a thermally sensitive 120mm HDB fan. It spins based on the system's temperature, constantly adjusting to keep your PSU running smoothly and safely with the minimum amount of noise required. Getting power from the wall to the PSU and then to your components is a tricky situation. The power comes in one voltage level, but your components need a different one. That power has to first be transferred to/through a converter in order to make it safe for your parts to use without overloading. The lines/rails used to initially move power from the wall to the converter need to be reliable and consistent to ensure your system's overall performance. That's why the MWE Bronze only uses one +12V rail for this process. This way all the components in your system are constantly fed the same power from the same source in order to guarantee consistency between all connections. Power comes in multiple voltage levels. The wall delivers power in one voltage level but your components each need a specific voltage to operate properly. The process of converting raw power from the wall to the multiple voltage levels your components need requires special components to complete this process quickly, efficiently, and safely. The MWE Bronze's DC-to-DC + LLC technology was painstakingly crafted to accomplish this goal. The Dual Forward circuit layout has been designed to convert 12V power to 3V and 5V levels with minimal ripple noise, 80 PLUS Bronze efficiency, and reduced risk to your connected components. For many PC Builders with aesthetics in mind, cabling can be one of the most troublesome parts of assembling a PC. Cables can be confusing, too short or too long, and they almost never look good. The MWE Bronze - V2 uses flat and flexible black cables to help deal with these problems. These cables are more discrete and flexible, making them easier to implement into your system while taking up less space. This is especially useful for smaller cases and preserving airflow. The many processes required by a power supply unit in order to take power directly from the wall or other fixed power source, convert it to the correct output required by the connected components, and then distribute that power to said components safely can be full of risks. This is why it's important for a PSU to have the right protections and regulations to ensure this process runs correctly. The MWE Bronze - V2 is a safe, reliable product and as such Cooler Master is happy to offer a standard 5 year manufacturing warranty for all units in the series. </p>\n","specifications":[{"heading":"Key Features","values":[{"key":"Efficiency (Approx.)","value":"Efficiency: 88%"},{"key":"Certification","value":"80 PLUS Bronze EU 230V"},{"key":"Fan Size","value":"120mm"}]},{"heading":"Input","values":[{"key":"Voltage","value":"Input Voltage: 200-240Vac"},{"key":"Frequency Range","value":"50-60Hz"},{"key":"Current","value":"10-6A"}]},{"heading":"Output","values":[{"key":"Modular Type","value":"Non Modular"},{"key":"Total Power","value":"MWE 750W"},{"key":"DC Output","value":"DC to DC topology technologies"}]},{"heading":"Connector","values":[{"key":"Main Power","value":"ATX 24-PIN CONNECTORS: 1"},{"key":"CPU","value":"EPS 4+4 PIN CONNECTORS: 1"},{"key":"PCI-E","value":"PCI-E 6+2 PIN CONNECTORS: 4"},{"key":"SATA","value":"SATA CONNECTORS: 6"},{"key":"Molex","value":"PERIPHERAL 4-PIN CONNECTORS: 3"}]},{"heading":"Warranty Information","values":[{"key":"Manufacturing Warranty","value":"05 Years Warranty"}]}],"latest_price":{"heading":"What is the price of Cooler Master MWE 750W V2 Power Supply in Bangladesh?","paragraph":"The latest price of Cooler Master MWE 750W V2 Power Supply in Bangladesh is 7,400৳.
