SSDs are fast, but expensive, and offer minimal capacity. Mechanical hard drives boast large capacity for a low price, but are much slower than an SSD. AMD StoreMI technology â€œcombinesâ€� these two types of storage into a single drive and automatically moves the data you access the most to the SSD, so you get the best of both worlds: SSD responsiveness, and mechanical hard disk capacity. You can also use up to 2GB of RAM as a last-level cache for ultra-fast data.<br></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Dual M.2 For SSD</span></p><p>Equipped with M.2 slot that supports both SATA3 6Gb/s and PCIe Gen3 x4 Ultra M.2 interface that pushes data transfer speeds up to 32Gb/s, and is compatible with ASRockâ€™s U.2 Kit for installing some of the worldâ€™s fastest U.2 PCIe Gen3 x4 SSD.</p>","specifications":[{"heading":"Basic Information","values":[{"key":"Supported CPU","value":"- AMD AM4 Socket"},{"key":"Chipset","value":"AMD Promontory B450"},{"key":"BIOS","value":"- 128Mb AMI UEFI Legal BIOS with multilingual GUI support"},{"key":"Form Factor","value":"- Micro ATX Form Factor: 9.6-in x 9.6-in, 24.4 cm x 24.4 cm"},{"key":"Audio","value":"- 7.1 CH HD Audio with Content Protection (Realtek ALC892 Audio Codec)"}]},{"heading":"Expansion Slots","values":[{"key":"PCI","value":"AMD Ryzen series CPUs (Summit Ridge and Pinnacle Ridge)"},{"key":"M.2 Socket","value":"- 1 x Ultra M.2 Socket (M2_1), supports M Key type 2242/2260/2280 M.2 PCI Express module up to Gen3 x4 (32 Gb/s) (with Summit Ridge, Raven Ridge and Pinnacle Ridge) or Gen3 x2 (16 Gb/s) (with Athlon 2xxGE series APU)"}]},{"heading":"Memory","values":[{"key":"Type","value":"Dual Channel DDR4 Memory Technology"},{"key":"Slots","value":"4 x DDR4 DIMM Slots"},{"key":"Supported Memory","value":"- AMD Ryzen series CPUs (Pinnacle Ridge) support DDR4 3200+(OC) / 2933(OC) / 2667/2400/2133 ECC & non-ECC, un-buffered memory"},{"key":"Maximum Memory","value":"64GB"}]},{"heading":"Graphics","values":[{"key":"Graphics","value":"- Integrated AMD Radeon Vega Series Graphics in Ryzen Series APU"},{"key":"Max Shared Memory","value":"16 GB"}]},{"heading":"Connector & Ports","values":[{"key":"HDMI","value":"1 x HDMI Port"},{"key":"Display Port (s)","value":"1 x DVI-D Port"},{"key":"D-Sub (s)","value":"1 x D-Sub Port"},{"key":"DVI-D (s)","value":"1 x DVI-D Port"},{"key":"USB (s)","value":"- 2 x USB 2.0 Ports (Supports ESD Protection)"},{"key":"LAN Port (s)","value":"- PCIE x1 Gigabit LAN 10/100/1000 Mb/s"},{"key":"Supported Storage","value":"- 4 x SATA3 6.0 Gb/s Connectors, support RAID (RAID 0, RAID 1 and RAID 10), NCQ, AHCI and Hot Plug"},{"key":"Audio","value":"- 7.1 CH HD Audio with Content Protection (Realtek ALC892 Audio Codec)"},{"key":"Internal I/O Ports","value":"- 1 x PS/2 Mouse Port"},{"key":"TPM (Trusted Platform Module )","value":"1 x TPM Header"}]},{"heading":"Others","values":[{"key":"Special Features","value":"ASRock Super Alloy"},{"key":"Bundled Software","value":"Software"}]},{"heading":"Warranty Information","values":[{"key":"Manufacturing Warranty","value":"03 years"}]}],"latest_price":{"heading":"What is the price of Asrock B450M Pro4-F AMD Motherboard in Bangladesh?","paragraph":"The latest price of Asrock B450M Pro4-F AMD Motherboard in Bangladesh is 10,700৳.
