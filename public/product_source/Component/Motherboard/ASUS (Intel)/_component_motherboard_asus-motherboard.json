Engineered with highly durable components, these motherboards deliver unwavering stability for gaming sessions that last as long as you demand. When you build with a TUF Gaming motherboard, you also benefit from the TUF Gaming Alliance â€” an ASUS collaboration with trusted industry partners that ensures easier building, the best compatibility, and complementary aesthetics from components to case. TUF Gaming motherboards offer easy and safe DIY builds by leveraging great design, innovative engineering, and strong partnerships with major component manufacturers. The unrivalled combination of military-grade TUF Components, TUF Protection and the TUF Gaming Alliance means that you can rest assured that your gaming rig will go the distance. TUF Gaming Alliance is the marque of collaboration between ASUS and major PC-component manufacturers, including trusted brands like Ballistix, Cooler Master, Corsair, G.Skill, In Win and Themaltake. A growing range of compliant parts, from PC chassis and power supplies to CPU coolers and DRAM, guarantee both compatibility and aesthetic harmony. We're also continually increasing our partnerships, making the TUF Gaming Alliance ever stronger. SafeSlot Core+ is the ASUS-exclusive PCIe slot fortified with a one-piece stainless-steel brace that shields the slot to protect it from damage. The metal cover is tightly secured to the slot with hooks, and the entire assembly is firmly anchored to the PCB with strengthened solder points to provide a secure foundation for heavyweight graphics cards. System temperatures are key to a stable gaming rig. TUF Gaming motherboards include FAN Xpert 2+ software that's able to intelligently control system fans based upon the input of sensor. This ensures that your TUF Gaming system stays perfectly cooled, no matter how long you play. ASUS OptiMem preserves memory signal integrity by routing traces and vias to the optimal PCB layer, and our T-Topology trace layout ensures time-aligned signaling by balancing trace lengths between memory slots. These enhancements allow the TUF Gaming motherboards to support a wide range of dual and quad-DIMM memory kits, while providing your rig with the stability it needs to deal with any type of workload - whether you're gaming or running intensive applications. A well-tuned system deserves a matching aesthetic. ASUS Aura offers full RGB lighting control with a variety of functional presets for the built-in RGB LEDs as well as strips connected to the onboard RGB headers. And it can all be synced with an ever-growing portfolio of Aura-capable hardware. TUF LANGuard is a military-grade innovation that integrates advanced signal-coupling technology and premium surface-mounted capacitors to improve throughput, protecting the motherboard from lightning strikes and static electricity.<br></p>","specifications":[{"heading":"Basic Information","values":[{"key":"Supported CPU","value":"Intel Socket 1151 9th / 8th Gen Intel® Core, Pentium Gold and Celeron Processors"},{"key":"Chipset","value":"Intel B365"},{"key":"BIOS","value":"128Mb Flash ROM, UEFI AMI BIOS, PnP, SM BIOS 3.1, ACPI 6.1, Multi-language BIOS, ASUS EZ Flash 3, CrashFree BIOS 3, F3 My Favorites, Last Modified log, F6 Qfan Control, F12 PrintScreen, and ASUS DRAM SPD (Serial"},{"key":"Form Factor","value":"mATX Form Factor"}]},{"heading":"Expansion Slots","values":[{"key":"PCI","value":"1 x PCIe 3.0 x16 (x16 mode)"},{"key":"M.2 Socket","value":"1 x M.2 Socket 3, with M key, type 2242/2260/2280 storage devices support (SATA & PCIE 3.0 x 4 mode)"}]},{"heading":"Memory","values":[{"key":"Type","value":"Dual Channel Memory Architecture"},{"key":"Slots","value":"4 x DIMM DDR4"},{"key":"Supported Memory","value":"DDR4 2666MHz and higher memory modules will run at max. 2666MHz on Intel® 8th Gen. 6-core or higher processors"},{"key":"Maximum Memory","value":"64GB"}]},{"heading":"Graphics","values":[{"key":"Graphics","value":"Integrated Graphics Processor- Intel® HD Graphics support"},{"key":"Max Shared Memory","value":"Maximum shared memory of 1024 MB (for iGPU exclusively)"}]},{"heading":"Connector & Ports","values":[{"key":"HDMI","value":"1 x HDMI resolution 4096 x 2160 @ 30 Hz"},{"key":"Display Port (s)","value":"1 x DisplayPort 1.2 resolution 4096 x 2304 @ 60 Hz"},{"key":"DVI-D (s)","value":"1 x DVI-D resolution 1920 x 1200 @ 60 Hz"},{"key":"USB (s)","value":"Intel B365 Chipset :"},{"key":"LAN Port (s)","value":"Intel I219V, 1 x Gigabit LAN"},{"key":"Supported Storage","value":"1 x M.2 Socket 3, with M key, type 2242/2260/2280 storage devices support (SATA & PCIE 3.0 x 4 mode)"},{"key":"Audio","value":"Realtek ALC1200 8-Channel High Definition Audio CODEC"},{"key":"Internal I/O Ports","value":"1 x Addressable RGB header"}]},{"heading":"Others","values":[{"key":"Special Features","value":"ASUS TUF PROTECTION"}]},{"heading":"Warranty Information","values":[{"key":"Manufacturing Warranty","value":"03 Years"}]}],"latest_price":{"heading":"What is the price of Asus TUF B365M-Plus Gaming Motherboard in Bangladesh?","paragraph":"The latest price of Asus TUF B365M-Plus Gaming Motherboard in Bangladesh is 10,700৳.
