Sporting a robust layered construction, shock sensors, and AES 256-bit encryption, the ADATA HD680 1TB/2TB External Hard Drive has you covered! The HD680 meets the U.S. Military MIL-STD-810G 516.6 standard. It achieves this with a triple-layer construction that consists of a shock-absorbing silicone casing, sturdy buffer, and a cushioned mounting for the hard drive. This results in an external HDD that can survive falls from up to 1.22 meters. In an age of 4K video and other high-resolution content, GBs just donâ€™t cut it anymore. Luckily, the HD680 comes with up to 2TB of storage capacity. The drive has a nifty groove that goes around its shell, serving as a convenient way to store the detachable USB cable. When not in use, simply disconnect the cable, and wrap it around the HD680. Dropping or bumping an HDD can result in errors and bad sectors. The HD680 features shock sensors that notify you when impact or shaking has been detected with a red indicator light. AES 256-bit encryption keeps the data inside password-protected and away from prying eyes. </p><div class=\"video-wrapper\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pEsqQ5MSx3Q\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div>","specifications":[{"heading":"Key Features","values":[{"key":"Type","value":"External"},{"key":"Capacity","value":"2TB"},{"key":"Interface","value":"USB 3.2 Gen1 ( Backward compatible with USB 2.0 )"}]},{"heading":"Warranty Information","values":[{"key":"Manufacturing Warranty","value":"3 Years"}]}],"latest_price":{"heading":"What is the price of ADATA HD680 External Hard Drive in Bangladesh?","paragraph":"The latest price of ADATA HD680 External Hard Drive in Bangladesh is 8,200৳.
