At maximum load, the pump produces a noise level of only 30 dBA, ensuring that your system runs smoothly without generating excessive noise. The pump's power consumption is also remarkably low, drawing a maximum of 3.0W. This energy-efficient design allows for effective cooling without putting a strain on your power supply. The Aqua Elite 240 ARGB's pump operates at a rated voltage of 12V DC and draws an amperage of 0.24±20% A. It features a 4-Pin PWM connector, which enables you to control the pump's speed and fine-tune the cooling performance to your preferences. This cooler incorporates a 3-Pin 5V ARGB connector, allowing you to synchronize the lighting effects with other compatible components in your system and create stunning lighting displays. The radiator of the cooler is made of high-quality aluminum, known for its excellent thermal conductivity. The combination of the efficient pump and the aluminum radiator ensures that heat is efficiently transferred away from your CPU. The pump boasts a Mean Time to Failure (MTTF) of 40,000 hours, providing peace of mind that your cooling solution will last for a long time. The Thermalright Aqua Elite 240 ARGB CPU Cooler is a high-performance liquid cooling solution that not only keeps your CPU cool but also adds a vibrant touch to your gaming rig with its customizable RGB lighting. Its powerful and efficient pump, combined with the aluminum radiator, ensures effective heat dissipation, making it an excellent choice for both casual users and enthusiasts seeking top-tier cooling performance.</p><h2 style=\"\"><span style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit;\">Buy&nbsp;</span>Thermalright Aqua Elite 240 White ARGB CPU Cooler<span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit;\">&nbsp;from Star Tech</span></span><br></h2><p>In Bangladesh, you can get original&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/thermalright-aqua-elite-240-white-argb-cpu-cooler\" target=\"\">Thermalright Aqua Elite 240 White ARGB CPU Cooler</a>&nbsp;From Star Tech.
