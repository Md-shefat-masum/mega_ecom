Moreover, the improved universal bracket designs ensure easy and worry-free installation on all platforms. Positioned at a 45-degree angle and surrounding the Heatpipe, each fin-blade features X-shaped vents that create areas of high and low air pressure, resulting in several controlled vortices. These small and chaotic turbulences produce strong gusts that reduce overall airflow but improve airflow where it matters the most â€“ next to the heat pipes. Funnel-shaped aluminum fins and a series of perforated dimples guide the airflow towards the heat pipes. Specially designed X-Vents, that act similar to tiny airplane wings and prevent deadspots behind and between heat pipes. 4 Continuous Direct Contact Heatpipes create a gap-less contact surface for unmatched cooling efficiency. It is fast and easy to install and extremely reliable, our famous X-Bracket mounting system is compatible with all current sockets. The POM bearing is coated with Polyoxymethylene material.

In this CPU Cooler, the dual tower heatsink has a combination of 2 sets of heatsink towers with 2 sets of MasterFan MF120R RGB. The uniquely designed heatsink allows bigger and more spread out surface area, while the MF120R RGB fans give added air pressure from the outside and inside the heatsink to generate massive cooling performance. You can add up to 3 fans to accelerate the air pressure and removal of heat with the 'Push and Pull'. One fan is placed at the front to pull cool air in, the second fanis placed inbetween the heatsinks, with the option to add third to maximize the heat pass-through. In this CPU Cooler, the MasterFan MF120R RGB operates quietly even at high speeds and also designed with a combination of jet engine and helicopter blades for the static air pressure. It is Continuous Direct Contact Technology 2.0 (CDC 2.0), the contact surface area of heatpipes to the base is increased by 45%. The heat transfer mechanism and significantly improves conductance and cooling capability. Here, wired RGB LED controller is included 100M to personalize the RGB lighting anytime. The MasterAir MA620P has 6 x heatpipes for fast transfer of heat, to make sure the CPU is running at optimal performance. Combined with the twin tower and dual fan design, you can even maximum TDP for the extreme overclockers.

With 4 heatpipes and Direct Contact technology, this outperforms its predecessor Hyper 103. The special fin design optimizes air flow toward heatpipes. Its 92mm PWM fan features a wide fan speed range and can be fine tuned for maximum airflow and cooling performance or silent operation. With height of 136.5mm, the Hyper H410R is a compact tower cooler, designed to fit in tight builds. With its outstanding performance in its class, it is a great solution for Micro ATX and Mini ITX boards. Just like the Hyper 212, it includes 4X Direct Contact heatpipes constructed out of copper to accelerate the heat conduction through the entire heatpipe. This allows heat to be dissipated quickly and efficiently throught the funnel shaped aluminum fins. Cooler Master's years of aluminum fin craftmanship is second to none. Optimized fin stacked distance between each layer is based on stringent airflow tests from our labs. As a result, even with a compact-size each heatsink with the 92mmm fan is able to maintain performance in a compact build. Tool-free mounting system ensures hassle-free installation. Universal retention brackets are compatible with latest Intel and AMD socket CPU.</div><p></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><br></span></p>","specifications":[{"heading":"Key Features","values":[{"key":"Type","value":"Air Cooler"},{"key":"Fan Speed","value":"600-2,000 RPM (PWM) ± 10%"},{"key":"Fan Airflow","value":"34.13 CFM ± 10%"},{"key":"Noise","value":"29.4 dBA"},{"key":"Air Pressure","value":"1.79mm H2O ± 10%"},{"key":"Connector","value":"4-Pin"},{"key":"Material","value":"4 Heat Pipes / Direct Contact / Aluminum Fins"}]},{"heading":"Physical Specification","values":[{"key":"Dimension","value":"DIMENSIONS: 102 x 83.4 x 136mm"},{"key":"Weight","value":"358g"}]},{"heading":"Supported Sockets","values":[{"key":"Intel","value":"LGA 1151 / 1150 / 1155 / 1156 / 775"},{"key":"AMD","value":"AM4 / AM3+ / AM3 / AM2+ / AM2 / FM2+ / FM2 / FM1"}]},{"heading":"Warranty Information","values":[{"key":"Warranty","value":"01 Year Warranty"}]}],"latest_price":{"heading":"What is the price of Cooler Master Hyper H410R CPU Cooler in Bangladesh?","paragraph":"The latest price of Cooler Master Hyper H410R CPU Cooler in Bangladesh is 0৳.

With 4 heatpipes and Direct Contact technology, this outperforms its predecessor Hyper 103. The special fin design optimizes air flow toward heatpipes. Its 92mm PWM fan features a wide fan speed range and can be fine tuned for maximum airflow and cooling performance or silent operation. With height of 136.5mm, the Hyper H410R is a compact tower cooler, designed to fit in tight builds. With its outstanding performance in its class, it is a great solution for Micro ATX and Mini ITX boards. Just like the Hyper 212, it includes 4X Direct Contact heatpipes constructed out of copper to accelerate the heat conduction through the entire heatpipe. This allows heat to be dissipated quickly and efficiently throught the funnel shaped aluminum fins. Cooler Master's years of aluminum fin craftmanship is second to none. Optimized fin stacked distance between each layer is based on stringent airflow tests from our labs. As a result, even with a compact-size each heatsink with the 92mmm fan is able to maintain performance in a compact build. Tool-free mounting system ensures hassle-free installation.

One of its most notable features is the automated ARGB (Addressable RGB) lighting system, which not only adds a bright touch to your system but does it seamlessly by intuitively identifying and giving a preset ARGB spectrum lighting setting. This eliminates the need for users to do manual configuration, streamlining the entire installation procedure. The HYPER 620S's cooling effectiveness is owed to its six nickel-plated heat pipes, which are designed for consistent heat distribution and efficient heat transmission. The nickel-plated base provides total coverage, maximizing heat dispersion for improved cooling performance. This is especially useful for people involved in resource-intensive activities like gaming or content production, where maintaining ideal CPU temperatures is critical for prolonged performance. The HYPER 620S is designed with adaptability in mind, having a minimum height of 154.9mm. This makes it compatible with a broad range of PC cases, fitting a variety of height requirements and allowing for flexible system configurations. The cooler's versatility is further enhanced by its compatibility with a variety of CPU sockets, including LGA1700, LGA1200, LGA1151, LGA1150, LGA1155, LGA1156, AM5, and AM4. This extensive compatibility guarantees that the HYPER 620S may be smoothly integrated into systems running various Intel and AMD CPUs. The HYPER 620S advances cooling technology by incorporating CryoFuze technology. This novel feature employs nanoparticles to achieve high thermal conductivity, which contributes to increased cooling efficiency. As a consequence, the cooler can maintain appropriate CPU temperatures even under heavy workloads.
