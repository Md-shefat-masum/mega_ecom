Installation is straightforward: if you can get to the back of your PCâ€™s motherboard, you can install an H45. All youâ€™ll need is a screwdriver. The compact components and flexible tubing make Hydro Series H45 easy to install even if youâ€™re cramped for space. It allows you to improve your CPUâ€™s cooling efficiency even in most compact cases â€” as long as your case has a 120mm fan mount near the CPU, the H45 will probably fit. Serious liquid cooling for high-performance CPUs no longer means dealing with complex plumbing. Hydro Series H60 comes pre-filled, and never needs refilling or priming. Minimal coolant evaporation helps ensure long life, and the resilient rubber offers both high flexibility and excellent leak protection. The pump unit provides high-speed circulation without taking a lot of space. This makes installation easier, and helps improve your caseâ€™s airflow. Copper has better thermal conductivity for more efficient heat transfer to the manifold. Pre-applied thermal compound lets you save a potentially messy installation step.  <br></p>","specifications":[{"heading":"Key Features","values":[{"key":"Type","value":"All-in-one liquid cooler"},{"key":"Fan Speed","value":"2300 RPM"},{"key":"Fan Airflow","value":"94 CFM"},{"key":"Noise","value":"31 dBA"},{"key":"Air Pressure","value":"3.65 mm-H2O"},{"key":"Material","value":"Cold Plate Material: Copper"}]},{"heading":"Physical Specification","values":[{"key":"Dimension","value":"1 Fan: 120 x 120 x 25 mm"}]},{"heading":"Supported Sockets","values":[{"key":"Intel","value":"1150/ 1151/ 1155/ 1156/ 2011/ 2066"},{"key":"AMD","value":"AM3/ AM2/ AM4"}]},{"heading":"Warranty Information","values":[{"key":"Warranty","value":"02 year"}]}],"latest_price":{"heading":"What is the price of Corsair Hydro Series H45 CPU Cooler in Bangladesh?","paragraph":"The latest price of Corsair Hydro Series H45 CPU Cooler in Bangladesh is 5,000৳.

Building a small form factor system shouldn't have to mean compromising on processor speed, and with the H5 SF you can provide reliable cooling for your system's high performance CPU. The H5 SF solves the problem of providing effective liquid cooling for high performance CPUs in cases where a full-sized Hydro Series liquid CPU cooler won't fit. The H5 SF was originally developed for the Corsair Bulldog living room gaming system, but it also works great in other Corsair small form factor chassis with dual rear 80mm fan mounts. It has a pump assembly with a copper coldplate and flexible, low permeability tubing, just like our larger Hydro Series models. They're matched with a one-piece blower which cools the circulated liquid by drawing cool air from the inside of your PC and exhausting it outside the case. So, in addition to keeping your CPU cool, the H5 SF provides additional cooling for the motherboard and other components by constantly pulling cool air across them. The low permeability tubing helps ensure long life, and the flexible design makes installation easier in tight spaces. The cold plate uses copper for its excellent heat transfer properties, and pre-applied thermal compound saves you time and mess during installation. <br></p>","specifications":[{"heading":"Key Features","values":[{"key":"Type","value":"All-in-one liquid cooler"},{"key":"Fan Speed","value":"1800 RPM"},{"key":"Fan Airflow","value":"24 CFM"},{"key":"Noise","value":"36 - 42 dBa"},{"key":"Air Pressure","value":"2.5 - 8.3 mm-H2O"},{"key":"Connector","value":"PWM: Yes"},{"key":"Material","value":"Cold Plate Material: Copper"}]},{"heading":"Physical Specification","values":[{"key":"Dimension","value":"Fan Dimensions: 120mm x 32mm"}]},{"heading":"Supported Sockets","values":[{"key":"Intel","value":"1200, 1150, 1151, 1155, 1156, 1366"},{"key":"AMD","value":"AM3, AM2"}]},{"heading":"Warranty Information","values":[{"key":"Warranty","value":"02 year"}]}],"latest_price":{"heading":"What is the price of Corsair Hydro H5 SF Low-Profile CPU Cooler in Bangladesh?","paragraph":"The latest price of Corsair Hydro H5 SF Low-Profile CPU Cooler in Bangladesh is 6,200৳.

Delivers a flow rate of up to 0.82L/min while generating less than 20 dBA, for extreme cooling with low noise. Each ELITE CAPELLIX CPU cooler includes two separate pump caps. The pre-installed pump cap is a stylish, glossy black, while the alternate pump cap is more transparent to let your CAPELLIX LEDs shine through. Harness the power of iCUE with the included iCUE Commander CORE to control the fan speed and RGB lighting for the included ML RGB fans, with the potential to control additional CORSAIR RGB fans, up to a total of six. Adjust fan and pump speeds, control and synchronize your cooler's RGB lighting with all iCUE-compatible devices, and monitor CPU and coolant temperatures, all from a single intuitive interface. CORSAIR ML RGB Series PWM fans deliver powerful airflow for extreme CPU cooling performance, with eight RGB LEDs per fan. Zero RPM cooling profiles in CORSAIR iCUE software allow fans to stop entirely at low temperatures, eliminating fan noise. <br></p>","specifications":[{"heading":"Key Features","values":[{"key":"Type","value":"Liquid Cooler"},{"key":"Fan Speed","value":"2000 RPM"},{"key":"Fan Airflow","value":"97 CFM"},{"key":"Noise","value":"10 - 36 dBA"},{"key":"Air Pressure","value":"3.0 mm-H2O"},{"key":"Connector","value":"PWM"},{"key":"LED Number","value":"RGB"},{"key":"Material","value":"Radiator Material: Aluminum"}]},{"heading":"Physical Specification","values":[{"key":"Dimension","value":"Tubing Length: 380mm"}]},{"heading":"Supported Sockets","values":[{"key":"Intel","value":"1200, 1150, 1151, 1155, 1156, 1366, 2011, 2066"},{"key":"AMD","value":"AM4, AM3, AM2, sTRX4, sTR4"}]},{"heading":"Warranty Information","values":[{"key":"Warranty","value":"5 Years"}]}],"latest_price":{"heading":"What is the price of Corsair iCUE H115i 280mm Elite Capellix CPU Cooler in Bangladesh?","paragraph":"The latest price of Corsair iCUE H115i 280mm Elite Capellix CPU Cooler in Bangladesh is 14,000৳.
