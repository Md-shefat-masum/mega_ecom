The TOUGHER 310 is a single-tower air cooler with four heat pipes going through the fins. The U-shape heat pipes promote heat circulation in your system, resulting in better heat dissipation, and it supports up to 170W. The TOUGHER series uses high static pressure fans, which take advantage of the TOUGHFAN 12 design and enhance the fan speed to 2000 RPM, giving our CPU cooler a new level of cooling performance. The asymmetric structure of the fin allows for greater air intake via the fins. This design reduces air turbulence and straightens the airflow, making it easier to remove heat from the fins and resulting in superior cooling. It has 4 x Ã˜6 mm heat pipes directly touching the CPU and thermal paste. The U-shape design creates perfect circulation for better CPU cooling performance.
