The 47 addressable RGB LEDs embedded in the GALAHAD 360 (35 LEDs in the GALAHAD 240) ensure brighter and more complex lighting effects. The GALAHAD AIO is compatible with most mainstream motherboard software, allowing users to create a synchronized system with ease. Through the included controller, switching between 17 lighting effects is a breeze. The CPU block pump features an aluminum housing to adorn your build with an exquisite metallic touch. The CPU block can be rotated to ensure a properly aligned logo no matter what the orientation of the block is. Both sides of the radiator feature an exquisite brushed aluminum shield, which not only serves as protection for the radiator, ensuring a higher level of durability but also adds an understated metal elegance to your builds. The all-new GALAHAD series features a state-of-the-art triple-chamber pump design that combines the pump chamber, the connecting chamber, and the cold plate chamber into one unit to significantly reduce the friction produced by the coolant's rapid flow. This design also serves as a protection mechanism to prevent your system from leaking should the CPU block pump be damaged. The M.C.T. design separates the hot and cool liquid flow by conveying them into different, sealed water passages, significantly enhancing the heat exchange efficiency and extending the lifespan of the CPU block pump by preventing the hot liquid from flowing back. The radiator encompasses 12 rows of aluminum tubes, allowing a maximum amount of liquid to pass through and transfer the heat out of the system efficiently. And thanks to the high-density fin folds between the aluminum tubes, the surface area providing heat dissipation is significantly increased. The GALAHAD AIO is equipped with a set of high static pressure fans for extreme cooling, ensuring immediate heat dissipation as the hot liquid passes through the radiator fins. In addition to providing cool air for the radiator, the high static pressure fans are capable of maintaining a low noise level while in operation. Each of the high-static pressure fans is propelled by an industrial-grade motor that enables the fans to operate silently at full speed. A thin layer of oily fluid wrapping the bearing effectively reduces the friction and noise caused by the moving parts. An extra magnetic force has been added to the center hub of the fan frame to support the fan blades, reducing the vibration level and thus ensuring a low noise level while in operation. The pump functions silently at the default setting (3300 RPM), and we advise not to adjust the pump speed. However, if users still want to eliminate the hardly detectable noise by adjusting the pump speed, go to the motherboard software or bios to adjust via voltage control. Easier to bend, strongly built, and extremely durable, the reinforced 400mm leakproof tubes have significantly enhanced flexibility. Both aesthetically pleasing and functionally focused, the optimized tubing design ensures a pain-free installation experience.

The 47 addressable RGB LEDs embedded in the GALAHAD 360 (35 LEDs in the GALAHAD 240) ensure brighter and more complex lighting effects. The GALAHAD AIO is compatible with most mainstream motherboard software, allowing users to create a synchronized system with ease. Through the included controller, switching between 17 lighting effects is a breeze. The CPU block pump features an aluminum housing to adorn your build with an exquisite metallic touch. The CPU block can be rotated to ensure a properly aligned logo no matter what the orientation of the block is. Both sides of the radiator feature an exquisite brushed aluminum shield, which not only serves as protection for the radiator, ensuring a higher level of durability but also adds an understated metal elegance to your builds. The all-new GALAHAD series features a state-of-the-art triple-chamber pump design that combines the pump chamber, the connecting chamber, and the cold plate chamber into one unit to significantly reduce the friction produced by the coolant's rapid flow. This design also serves as a protection mechanism to prevent your system from leaking should the CPU block pump be damaged.

The radiator encompasses 12 rows of aluminum tubes, allowing a maximum amount of liquid to pass through and transfer the heat out of the system efficiently. And thanks to the high-density fin folds between the aluminum tubes, the surface area providing heat dissipation is significantly increased. The GALAHAD AIO is equipped with a set of high static pressure fans for extreme cooling, ensuring immediate heat dissipation as the hot liquid passes through the radiator's fins. In addition to providing cool air for the radiator, the high static pressure fans are capable of maintaining a low noise level while in operation. Each of the high-static pressure fans is propelled by an industrial-grade motor that enables the fans to operate silently at full speed. A thin layer of oily fluid wrapping the bearing effectively reduces the friction and noise caused by the moving parts. An extra magnetic force has been added to the center hub of the fan frame to support the fan blades, reducing the vibration level and thus ensuring a low noise level while in operation. The pump functions silently at the default setting (3300 RPM), and we advise not to adjust the pump speed. However, if users still want to eliminate the hardly detectable noise by adjusting the pump speed, go to the motherboard software or bios to adjust via voltage control. Easier to bend, strongly built, and extremely durable, the reinforced 400mm leakproof tubes have significantly enhanced flexibility. Both aesthetically pleasing and functionally focused, the optimized tubing design ensures a pain-free installation experience. The GALAHAD AIO is compatible with most mainstream CPU sockets such as Intels LGA 115X, LGA 1366, LGA 775, 1200, 2011, 2066, LGA 1700, and AMDs AM4, allowing users to experience a hassle-free compatibility checking process.

Through the included controller, switching between 17 lighting effects is a breeze. The CPU block pump features an aluminum housing to adorn your build with an exquisite metallic touch. The CPU block can be rotated to ensure a properly aligned logo no matter what the orientation of the block is. Both sides of the radiator feature an exquisite brushed aluminum shield, which not only serves as protection for the radiator, ensuring a higher level of durability but also adds an understated metal elegance to your builds. The all-new GALAHAD series features a state-of-the-art triple-chamber pump design that combines the pump chamber, the connecting chamber, and the cold plate chamber into one unit to significantly reduce the friction produced by the coolant's rapid flow. This design also serves as a protection mechanism to prevent your system from leaking should the CPU block pump be damaged. The M.C.T. design separates the hot and cool liquid flow by conveying them into different, sealed water passages, significantly enhancing the heat exchange efficiency and extending the lifespan of the CPU block pump by preventing the hot liquid from flowing back. The radiator encompasses 12 rows of aluminum tubes, allowing a maximum amount of liquid to pass through and transfer the heat out of the system efficiently. And thanks to the high-density fin folds between the aluminum tubes, the surface area providing heat dissipation is significantly increased. The GALAHAD AIO is equipped with a set of high static pressure fans for extreme cooling, ensuring immediate heat dissipation as the hot liquid passes through the radiator's fins. In addition to providing cool air for the radiator, the high static pressure fans are capable of maintaining a low noise level while in operation. Each of the high-static pressure fans is propelled by an industrial-grade motor that enables the fans to operate silently at full speed. A thin layer of oily fluid wrapping the bearing effectively reduces the friction and noise caused by the moving parts. An extra magnetic force has been added to the center hub of the fan frame to support the fan blades, reducing the vibration level and thus ensuring a low noise level while in operation. The pump functions silently at the default setting (3300 RPM), and we advise not to adjust the pump speed. However, if users still want to eliminate the hardly detectable noise by adjusting the pump speed, go to the motherboard software or bios to adjust via voltage control. Easier to bend, strongly built, and extremely durable, the reinforced 400mm leakproof tubes have significantly enhanced flexibility. Both aesthetically pleasing and functionally focused, the optimized tubing design ensures a pain-free installation experience. The GALAHAD AIO is compatible with most mainstream CPU sockets such as Intels LGA 115X, LGA 1366, LGA 775, 1200, 2011, 2066, LGA1700, and AMDs AM4, allowing users to experience a hassle-free compatibility checking process. The included flippable modular mounting backplate ensures easy access to either Intel or AMD platforms.<br></p><div class=\"video-wrapper\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/E4l_6ceUNkY\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div>","specifications":[{"heading":"Key Features","values":[{"key":"Type","value":"360mm Closed-Loop AIO Liquid Cooler"},{"key":"Fan Speed","value":"800±200(30%DUTY) ~ 1900 RPM±10%"},{"key":"Fan Airflow","value":"66.04 CFM69.17 CFM"},{"key":"Noise","value":"32.dB (PUMP NOISE LEVEL: < 20 dBA)"},{"key":"Air Pressure","value":"2.6 mmH2O"},{"key":"Connector","value":"FAN POWER CONNECTOR: 4-PIN"},{"key":"Material","value":"RADIATOR MATERIALS: Aluminum and plastic"}]},{"heading":"Physical Specification","values":[{"key":"Dimension","value":"360mm: 397.5 x 123.5 x 27mm"}]},{"heading":"Supported Sockets","values":[{"key":"Intel","value":"LGA 115X, LGA 1366, LGA 775, LGA 1200, LGA 2011, LGA 2066, LGA 1700"},{"key":"AMD","value":"AM4"}]},{"heading":"Warranty Information","values":[{"key":"Warranty","value":"5 years warranty"}]}],"latest_price":{},"images":["https://www.startech.com.bd/image/cache/catalog/cpu-cooler/lian-li/galahad-360mm/galahad-360mm-3-500x500.jpg","https://www.startech.com.bd/image/cache/catalog/cpu-cooler/lian-li/galahad-360mm/galahad-360mm-1-500x500.jpg","https://www.startech.com.bd/image/cache/catalog/cpu-cooler/lian-li/galahad-360mm/galahad-360mm-6-500x500.jpg"],"product_seo_title":"Lian Li Galahad 360mm Liquid CPU Cooler Price in Bangladesh","product_seo_description":"Buy Lian Li Galahad 360mm Closed-Loop AIO Liquid CPU Cooler (White) at a competitive price in Bangladesh.
