The most astonishing fact of this Asus CPU Cooler is that it provides you with extravagant cooling and showing you all the vital information about your components through the built-in display screen on the pump head. The water block fan provides you with very high fans speed to cool the solution down fast and prevent your CPU from over heating. The Asus ROG Ryujin 240 RGB CPU Cooler comes with 2 of Noctua's very prestigious and advanced fans for the radiator cooling. These fans are hace a speed of 2000RPM and a static pressure of 3.94mmH2O.  <br></p><h3>COOL TO THE CORE<br></h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">ROG Ryujin meets the thermal challenges of the latest multi-core CPUs with industrial-grade Noctua iPPC-2000 PWM fans on the radiator that deliver high performance and low-noise operation. The 120-mm fans generate 122 m3h of airflow at 2,000 RPM yet are extremely efficient with a 29.7-dB(A) acoustic footprint thatâ€™s much quieter than competing fans. While powerful, liquid cooling does not circulate air around the CPU socket like a traditional heatsink and fan. ROG Ryujin overcomes this limitation with a 60mm fan embedded in the pump housing that circulates air to the CPU VRMs, M.2 slot and surrounding components to dramatically reduce temperatures for improved performance and stability.<br></p><h3>NEXT LEVEL OF CUSTOMIZATION<br></h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"> ROG Ryujin is the worldâ€™s first AIO cooler to feature an embedded 1.77-inch LiveDash color OLED that displays useful system information, such as temperatures, voltages, fan speeds, or frequencies. You can also customize LiveDash to display a customized image or animation** highlighting your clan insignia or gamertag. The LiveDash software utility lets you easily customize ROG Ryujinâ€™s LiveDash OLED display and RGB lighting effects. Select which system stats to monitor, choose personalized GIFs and images to display, and control RGB lighting from an intuitive interface that arranges settings in a step-by-step flow from top to bottom. Infused with Aura RGB lighting in dramatic slash patterns on the shroud, Ryujin exudes a vibrant glow that highlights the CPU at the heart of your build. The impact of Aura RGB lighting can be further enhanced with ASUS Aura Sync, which allows harmonized lighting effects with other Aura-enabled system components and external accessories. Aura software give you complete control of lighting across all compatible devices, letting you dial in the vibe you want to display quickly and easily.<br></p><h3>EXTENDED COMPATIBILITY<br></h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">ROG Ryujin is compatible with a wide range of Intel and AMD motherboard platforms, giving you the flexibility to pair it with your choice of processor.

The most astonishing fact about this Asus CPU Cooler is that it provides you with extravagant cooling and shows you all the vital information about your components through the built-in display screen on the pump head. The water block fan provides you with very high fan speed to cool the solution down fast and prevent your CPU from overheating. Asus ROG Ryujin 360 RGB CPU Cooler comes with 3 of Noctua's very prestigious and advanced fans for radiator cooling. These fans have a speed of 2000 RPM and static pressure of 3.94mmH2O.  <br></p>\n<h3>COOL TO THE CORE<br></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; \">ROG Ryujin meets the thermal challenges of the latest multi-core CPUs with industrial-grade Noctua iPPC-2000 PWM fans on the radiator that deliver high performance and low-noise operation. The 120-mm fans generate 122 m3h of airflow at 2,000 RPM yet are extremely efficient with a 29.7-dB(A) acoustic footprint that is much quieter than competing fans. While powerful, liquid cooling does not circulate air around the CPU socket like a traditional heatsink and fan. ROG Ryujin overcomes this limitation with a 60mm fan embedded in the pump housing that circulates air to the CPU VRMs, M.2 slot, and surrounding components to dramatically reduce temperatures for improved performance and stability.<br></p>\n<h3>NEXT LEVEL OF CUSTOMIZATION<br></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; \"> ROG Ryujin is the world's first AIO cooler to feature an embedded 1.77-inch LiveDash color OLED that displays useful system information, such as temperatures, voltages, fan speeds, or frequencies. You can also customize LiveDash to display a customized image or animation** highlighting your clan insignia or Gamertag. The LiveDash software utility lets you easily customize ROG Ryujins LiveDash OLED display and RGB lighting effects. Select which system stats to monitor, choose personalized GIFs and images to display, and control RGB lighting from an intuitive interface that arranges settings in a step-by-step flow from top to bottom. Infused with Aura RGB lighting in dramatic slash patterns on the shroud, Ryujin exudes a vibrant glow that highlights the CPU at the heart of your build. The impact of Aura RGB lighting can be further enhanced with ASUS Aura Sync, which allows harmonized lighting effects with other Aura-enabled system components and external accessories. Aura software gives you complete control of lighting across all compatible devices, letting you dial in the vibe you want to display quickly and easily.<br></p>\n<h3>EXTENDED COMPATIBILITY<br></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; \">ROG Ryujin is compatible with a wide range of Intel and AMD motherboard platforms, giving you the flexibility to pair it with your choice of processor.
