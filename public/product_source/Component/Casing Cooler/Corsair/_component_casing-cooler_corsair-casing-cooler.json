It provides powerful airflow while taking up little space. The AF SLIM Series is a low-profile variant of our highest-performing fan that fits compact form factor builds and offers comparable airflow at 56.3 CFM to the normal AF120 ELITE, the perfect blend of low noise and high performance. Allows for builds when full-size fans simply will not fit. The Corsair AF120 SLIM 120mm PWM Casing Fan ITX is very difficult to build and maintain. The durability of the fans is more crucial here than anywhere else. Fluid dynamic bearings in AF SLIM fans use lubricants to reduce friction between the shaft and bearings, delivering remarkable longevity and low noise.</p><h3>Low-Noise Design</h3><p>The Corsair AF120 SLIM 120mm PWM Casing Fan is designed to be low-noise, spinning as softly as 27.5 dBa. When your computer is not in use, Corsair's Zero RPM mode eliminates fan noise. Only when temperatures hit the threshold you set in Corsair's iCUE software with a Corsair Commander fan controller will fans start spinning.</p><h2>Buy Corsair AF120 SLIM 120mm PWM Casing Fan from Star Tech</h2><p>In Bangladesh, you can get original <a href=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/corsair-af120-slim-120mm-casing-fan\" target=\"_blank\">Corsair AF120 SLIM 120mm PWM Casing Fan</a> From Star Tech.
