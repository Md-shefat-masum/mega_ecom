Each fan has a speed range of 200 to 1800 rpm, controlled by PWM PST, and a complete stop function at 5% PWM for ultra-quiet operation. These fans have an airflow of 56.30 cfm (95.70 m³/h) and a static pressure of 2.20 mmH2O, ensuring excellent cooling in various settings. The fans are designed to work at ambient temperatures ranging from 0 to 40 °C and have a low noise level of 0.3 sone, due to their unique fluid dynamic bearings, which also increase longevity. The conventional fan frame design is enhanced with ARGB lighting, which adds bright aesthetics to any setup. The electrical features include a normal voltage of 12 V DC, a starting voltage of 3.9 V, and a current flow of 0.1 A. Each fan has a 400 mm cable with a 4-pin connection and a 4-pin socket for more flexibility and convenience of installation. The Arctic P12 PWM PST ARGB 120mm 3 in 1 Casing Fan Set is a fantastic alternative for people looking for a cooling solution that combines performance and aesthetics. </p><h3>Optimised for Static Pressure</h3><p>During the development of the new P12 PWM PST, a concentrated airstream was prioritized, resulting in a high static pressure. The fan ensures exceptionally effective cooling, even with increasing air resistance. As a result, the P12 PWM PST is best suited for usage on heatsinks and radiators.</p><h3>Strong Cooling Performance</h3><p>Numerous enhancements, such as upgraded engine technology and a newly created fan design, have significantly improved the performance of P fans. In internal performance testing set to 28 dB(A), the new P-fans outperformed numerous competitors. </p><h3>More Efficient Technology</h3><p>The motor is driven by a new generation PWM IC, allowing the <strong>P12 PWM PST</strong> to run considerably more effectively than its predecessors. This saves energy without reducing performance.</p><h3>Maximum Quietness, Minimum Vibration</h3><p>Even at low speeds, the new ARCTIC motor produces very little noise. Because of sinus magnetization, the new motor produces only around 5% of the vibration caused by the commutation of a standard DC motor without a filter. As a result of the new motor's consistent and smooth torque, rubber spacers are unnecessary.</p><h2>Buy Arctic P12 PWM PST ARGB 120mm 3 in 1 Casing Fan from Star Tech</h2><p>In Bangladesh, you can get the original <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Arctic P12 PWM PST ARGB 120mm 3 in 1 Casing Fan</span> From Star Tech.
