A fast and easy way to expand and accelerate the storage in a desktop PC with an AMD Ryzen processor. AMD StoreMI technology is a powerful tool for PC enthusiasts that want to improve load times, boot times, file management, or system responsiveness. Whatever your storage acceleration needs, AMD StoreMI technology automatically pairs your most-used files with an SSD cache for peak performance.&nbsp; MD StoreMI technology can get files running at SSD-like speeds. Simply add an SSD to your system and let StoreMI do the rest. It also has AMD \"Zen 3\" Core Architecture with the fastest cores in the world for PC gamers. The \"Zen 3\" architecture represents the most comprehensive design overhaul of the \"Zen\" era. Over 20 major changes include wider and more flexible execution resources; significantly more load/store bandwidth to feed execution; and a streamlined front-end to get more threads in flight and do it faster. The \"Zen 3\" architecture can extract an average of 19% additional performance from every MHz of frequency relative to the previous generation2. This is a historically large generational improvement in IPC, and a major player in the architectureâ€™s ability to deliver unmatched single-core performance. The \"Zen 3\" architecture transitions to a new \"unified complex\" design that brings 8 cores and 32MB of L3 cache into a single group of resources. This dramatically reduces core-to-core and core-to-cache latencies by making every element of the die a next-door neighbor with minimal communication time. Latency-sensitive tasks like PC gaming especially benefit from this change, as tasks now have direct access to twice as much L3 cache versus the Zen 2.

This processor stands with 3.5GHz Base Clock, 4.4GHz Max Boost Clock, 3MB L2 Cache, 32 MB L3 Cache with AM4 Package, and TSMC 7nm FinFET CMOS. This processor is built with PCIe 3.0 x8 and Wraith Spire Thermal Solution. The AMD Ryzen 5 5600 Processor provides DDR4 Up to 3200MHz memory with 2 memory channels. It has AMD StoreMI Technology which is a fast and easy way to expand and accelerate the storage in a desktop PC with an AMD Ryzen processor. AMD StoreMI technology is a powerful tool for PC enthusiasts that want to improve load times, boot times, file management, or system responsiveness. Whatever your storage acceleration needs, AMD StoreMI technology automatically pairs your most-used files with an SSD cache for peak performance. MD StoreMI technology can get files running at SSD-like speeds. Simply add an SSD to your system and let StoreMI do the rest. It also has AMD \"Zen 3\" Core Architecture with the fastest cores in the world for PC gamers. The \"Zen 3\" architecture represents the most comprehensive design overhaul of the \"Zen\" era. Over 20 major changes include wider and more flexible execution resources; significantly more load/store bandwidth to feed execution; and a streamlined front-end to get more threads in flight and do it faster. The \"Zen 3\" architecture can extract an average of 19% additional performance from every MHz of frequency relative to the previous generation2. This is a historically large generational improvement in IPC and a major player in this architecture's ability to deliver unmatched single-core performance. The \"Zen 3\" architecture transitions to a new \"unified complex\" design that brings 8 cores and 32MB of L3 cache into a single group of resources. This dramatically reduces core-to-core and core-to-cache latencies by making every element of the die a next-door neighbor with minimal communication time. Latency-sensitive tasks like PC gaming especially benefit from this change, as tasks now have direct access to twice as much L3 cache versus the Zen 2. It also features the AMD Ryzen VR-Ready Premium for the best possible VR experience possible.

With its launch on 08.10.2020, it is the fastest 8-core processor from AMD.  </p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The Ryzen 7 5800X clocks with a base clock of 3.8 GHz and reaches up to 4.7 GHz on one core in turbo mode. When all 8 cores are utilized, the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X achieves up to 4.5 GHz. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The performance of AMD Ryzen 7 5800X is consistently very good in all applications. Especially in multi-threaded applications, the native 8-core can show its strengths, although the single-core performance has been significantly improved compared to the older Zen 2 architecture. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The internal structure of the processor has not changed fundamentally. The CCX structure has changed somewhat compared to Zen2, because now a CCX consists of up to 8-CPU cores. So, each individual core can access the complete L3 cache (32 MB). Furthermore, the CCX modules are connected to each other via the same I/O die, which we already know from Zen2. According to AMD, the Infinity-Fabric should now reach clock rates of up to 2Ghz, which in turn allows a RAM clock of 4.000 MHz without performance loss. </p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">For the manufacturing processes, AMD also relies on TSCM for the Vermeer processors for the 7nm production of the CPU cores, although the I/O die is still supplied in 12nm by GlobalFoundries.  </p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">In games, AMD's Ryzen 7 5800X can convince with its significantly improved IPC and even put Intel in its place.

It reportedly features two Durango CCDs with 16 cores codenamed “Persephone”. The leaker claims that the battle for the top CPUs will be between 7950X’s 5.85 GHz and i9-13900K supposedly boosting up to 5.8 GHz with Thermal Velocity Boost. The sample that was described by “Venom” is not the top bin CPU.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Ryzen 7000 Series, the new generation of AMD CPU</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The Ryzen 7000 is AMD's first 5nm x86 CPU for desktop PCs, however, it doesn't have more cores than earlier-generation versions. But with the new Zen 4 microarchitecture, rates may reach 5.7 GHz, an astounding 800 MHz boost over the previous generation, and up to 13% more IPC. As a consequence, single-threaded performance is up 29% compared to the previous-generation CPUs. As for threaded workloads, AMD claims up to 45% greater performance in applications with higher performance requirements.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Latest AMD Socket AM5</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">It's time for AMD to switch to the brand-new AM5 platform with a new LGA1718 socket because the AM4 platform has been around for more than five years. In contrast to the previous PGA socket, the LGA socket will have pins rather than the CPU itself. Due to the opportunity, it offers for several new technologies, the AM5 platform will be a breath of fresh air. Expect increased overclocking headroom, additional ports, a larger PPT maximum (230W vs. 142W), and more.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Support for DDR5 RAM and PCIe 5.0</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">It's time to gradually phase out DDR4 in favor of DDR5, which offers the possibility of higher clock rates, lower power consumption, and lower latency. DDR4 opened the way for faster memory with very low latency. All AM5 motherboard versions will support PCIe 5.0. Therefore, PCIe 5.0 compatibility is required whether you purchase an X670 Extreme, X670, or B650.

With a default TDP of 105W, it achieves a balance between power efficiency and performance. The AMD Ryzen 7 5700X3D CPU may be used with a variety of chipsets, such as the X570, X470, B550, B450, and A520, and is compatible with the AM4 socket. Its precision boost technique optimizes workload execution by dynamically adjusting performance. High-speed data transfer is ensured by PCIe 4.0 support, and connectivity features include native USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports and support for USB Type-C. The Ryzen 7 5700X3D Processor is capable of handling the demands of contemporary computing work because it has NVMe support for boot and RAID setups, DDR4 memory support up to 128GB, and ECC compatibility (with motherboard support). Add to that features like AMD StoreMI Technology, Ryzen VR-Ready Premium certification, and Ryzen Master Utility, and you have a wonderful option for enthusiasts looking for high-performance computing solutions.</p><img src=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/image/catalog/processor/amd/ryzen-7-5700x3d/ryzen-7-5700x3d-02.webp\" alt=\"AMD Ryzen 7 5700X3D Processor\" width=\"920\" height=\"450\"><h2>Buy AMD Ryzen 7 5700X3D Processor from Star Tech</h2><p>In Bangladesh, you can get original <strong>AMD Ryzen 7 5700X3D Processor</strong> From Star Tech.
