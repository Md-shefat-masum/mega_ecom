A software upgrade is now available to support Sony's new Real-time Eye AF for Animals. The feature works by automatically detecting and tracking the eyes of animals that you're photographing, for beautiful pet portraits and wildlife shots. With outstanding imaging capability and high-speed performance contained in a compact body, the Î±7 III gives you the power, precision, and flexibility to capture once-in-a-lifetime moments just as you like. A newly developed back-illuminated image sensor and evolved image processing system fulfill various shooting needs with high-quality imaging capabilities that you would expect only of a full-frame camera. A new version of the 24.2-megapixel Exmor R CMOS sensor, now featuring a back-illuminated structure, is combined with the latest BIONZ X image processing engine and front-end LSI, and this combination achieves a data readout speed that is two times faster and data processing capability that is 1.8 times higher. The 35-mm full-frame CMOS image sensor with back-illuminated structure enhances light collection efficiency, expands circuitry scale, and, with the help of a copper wiring layer that contributes to quicker data transfer, outputs data at very high speed, while minimizing noise to reveal fine details in every picture. Standard ISO range is extended to ISO 100-51200 (expandable to ISO 50-204800 for stills), while Detail Reproduction and Area-specific Noise Reduction technologies maintain image details and cut noise. With highly effective performance in mid-to-high sensitivity ranges, you can shoot at high ISO with no concerns about noise or image deterioration. The latest high-precision stabilization uses stabilization unit and gyro sensors and algorithms to achieve a 5.0-step shutter speed advantage in a system that compensates five types of camera shake with a wide range of lenses and delivers excellent performance. For smoother, more natural gradation, the latest BIONZ X image processor and front-end LSI process image signals in 16-bit form. This processor also allows 14-bit RAW data output, even when in silent or continuous shooting mode. AF performance is improved using the same AF advancements as in the Î±9 and applying it optimally. Once the Î±7 III captures such unpredictably moving subjects as dancers, boxers, and wild animals in action, it wonâ€™t easily let them go.

The a7R 4th generation has an upgraded 61MP sensor, quicker processing, enhanced AF performance, and a more well-rounded feature set for both high-end picture and video applications. The newly built full-frame 61MP Exmor R CMOS sensor with a back-illuminated architecture gives amazing resolution with great clarity, low noise, and a broad 15-stop dynamic range. The shape of the sensor supports exceptional picture quality, and a copper wire layer substantially boosts data transfer speed for capturing 14-bit, high-resolution 61MP stills with a base sensitivity range of ISO 100-32000, which can be increased to ISO 50-102400.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">BIONZ X Image Processor</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Sony a7R IVA Mirrorless Camera's BIONZ X engine's high-speed image processing enables the quick continuous shooting, 4K video recording, and improved AF tracking. The rapid processing also aids in the reduction of rolling shutter and other motion aberrations for the clear portrayal of moving subjects. In terms of shooting rates, the sensor and CPU enable up to 10 fps shooting at full resolution for up to 68 consecutive frames, with full-time AF/AE.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Pixel Shift Multi Shooting</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This unique compositing mode allows you to achieve even greater resolution than the 61MP sensor affords. Working in conjunction with the sensor-shift image stabilization, this mode shifts the sensor while making 16 consecutive exposures to acquire approximately 240.8MP of information for greater color accuracy and detail than possible with a single exposure, along with an impressive image size of 19,008 x 12,672 pixels. These files can then be merged during post-production by using the Sony Imaging software suite.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Fast Hybrid AF System</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">An updated Fast Hybrid AF system now employs a combination of 567 phase-detection points, which cover approximately 99.7% of the height and 74% of the width of the frame, along with 425 contrast-detection areas for reliable and quick autofocus and subject tracking performance. This focusing system also achieves especially quick speed and reliable tracking, as well as enhanced low-light focusing response down to -3 EV. The apt focus system also lends itself to a variety of focusing functions for refined accuracy, including Lock-on AF, which maintains focus on moving subjects throughout the use of a configurable frame that is set over the desired moving subject and Expand Flexible Spot, which employs neighboring focus points to retain focus on moving subjects even if the originally selected point loses focus. Additionally, Eye AF can be used to base focus on recognized human subjects' eyes for portraits and is available in both AF-S and AF-C modes, for both stills and video. Eye AF can be used when photographing animal subjects, too, with any focusing mode when shooting stills. Autofocus can also be used in conjunction with the Focus Magnifier function for critical focus when homing in on minute subject details. The rear touchscreen can also be used for Touch Focus control, and a Touchpad Focus Control mode lets you use the rear screen intuitively while keeping your eye on the viewfinder.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">5-Axis SteadyShot INSIDE Image Stabilization</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Sony a7R IVA includes a 5.5-stop effective 5-axis SteadyShot INSIDE image stabilization technology that adjusts for five different forms of camera shaking experienced during handheld stills and video shooting. This enables users to comfortably utilize any lens, even adapted lenses, for important images without experiencing blur caused by camera motion. The device will compensate for pitch and yaw modifications for extended focal lengths. The incorporation of horizontal and vertical shift correction, on the other hand, will assist macro and high-magnification pictures. The roll adjustment will be useful for all shooting techniques. Even when using third-party lenses and adapters or lenses with built-in optical stabilization, all 5 axes of stabilization will operate at all times.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">UHD 4K Video Recording in XAVC S Format</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Sony a7R IVA Mirrorless Camera has Internal recording of UHD 4K movies is supported at several frame rates up to 30 fps and, based on the Super35mm recording area and effective 6K resolution, oversampling produces additional detail and complete pixel readout is feasible, allowing for a higher quality picture with decreased moiré and aliasing. Full-frame 4K recording has also been significantly enhanced for increased quality while working at mid to high sensitivities, allowing full utilization of the sensor width. Full HD 1080p recording at frame rates up to 120 fps is also possible, and both resolutions use the 100 Mbps XAVC S codec housed behind an MP4 wrapper with 4:2:0 sampling.

This full-frame mirrorless camera was built without cutting corners and offers high-resolution still photography, stunning 8K video recording, speed and sensitivity, and connection for the most demanding professional workflows. The α1 offers high resolution and unprecedented speed combined with sensitivity and dynamic range that can bring the creator's vision to life.<br></p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">50.1MP Full-Frame BSI CMOS Sensor and BIONZ XR</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The Sony Alpha 1 has a full-frame stacked back-illuminated CMOS Exmor RSTM sensor with integrated memory and 50.1 effective megapixels. This not only produces excellent image quality but also enables the 1 to shoot continuously at up to 30 frames per second while providing quick, accurate phase-detection AF and the first full-frame 8.6K oversampled 8K movies in the series. Outstanding performance for a brand-new era of image creation.&nbsp;has a new system design and significantly better processing speed for all phases of signal processing, starting with image acquisition. For exceptional image quality, processing latency is reduced while image processing capability is considerably improved. Regardless of the real-time processing load, quick, stress-free control response is maintained thanks to distributed processing for user interface, network, and file management.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Continuous shooting at up to 30fps</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The Sony a1 with an electronic shutter can shoot up to 165 full-frame JPEG images4 or 155 full-frame compressed RAW images5 at up to 30 frames per second3 while maintaining full AF and AE tracking performance thanks to a fast readout from the 50.1-megapixel image sensor and a sizable buffer memory. When timing is crucial for sports and other dynamic subjects, this can be a tremendous confidence booster.<br></p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Silent, vibration-free electronic shutter</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">When filming sports or events in a calm atmosphere, the electronic shutter makes no mechanical noise. A second factor in the higher image quality is the electronic shutter's lack of vibration, which reduces the possibility of vibration-induced blur. Furthermore, compared to its mechanical counterpart, the electronic shutter is far more durable because it contains no moving parts.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">High resolution and sensitivity with 15-stop dynamic range</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The&nbsp; Alpha 1's 50.1 effective megapixel image sensor produces remarkable resolution because to highly effective noise-reduction technology. In addition to high sensitivity with minimal noise and roughly 15 stops12 of dynamic range at lower sensitivity levels for smooth, natural gradations from shadows to highlights, the resolution is further enhanced by these features.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Wide sensitivity range</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The new BIONZ XR image processing engine of Sony a1 works with this sensor's high pixel count, together with its back-illuminated structure, gapless on-chip lenses, AR-coated seal glass, and other unique imaging technologies, to produce great resolution and low noise over a broad sensitivity range: Standard ISO 100-32000, extendable to ISO 50-102400.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">5-axis optical in-body image stabilization</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The Sony Alpha 1's 50.1-megapixel sensor produces high-resolution photographs with the highest possible quality thanks to a high-precision stabilization unit, gyro sensors, and enhanced image stabilization algorithms. This results in a shutter speed advantage of up to 5.5 steps. The Active Mode on the 1 also provides excellent stabilization for handheld movie filming.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">759 point full-area phase-detection AF</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">A high-density focal plane phase-detection AF system with 759 phase-detection points covers almost 92% of the image area, ensuring accuracy and unwavering focus in situations when focusing could otherwise be challenging. Together with a 425-point contrast AF system, the 759-point focal plane phase-detection AF system ensures accurate AF performance in any situation.<br></p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">8K 30p and 4K 120p Support</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">Sony Alpha 1 Mirrorless Digital Camera comes with a high-resolution sensor and quick processing capability, UHD 8K 30p XAVC HS 10-bit 4:2:2 video recording is feasible using the full width of the sensor, providing 8.6K oversampling for excellent sharpness and realism.

The usage of a global shutter outperforms rolling shutter technology, which has been employed for decades. A global shutter allows for a nearly immediate and simultaneous reading of all 24.6MP, avoiding skew and other distortions that plagued rolling shutters. It also outperforms mechanical shutter technology in every manner, rendering the physical shutter obsolete with the Alpha a9 III.</p><h3>Pre-Capture and Speed Boost</h3><p>The Alpha a9 III may be set to start recording photos to the buffer while the shutter button is half pushed. Users can change this anywhere from 0.05 to 1.0 second. When you push the shutter, these photographs will be recorded on the memory card. Not every shoot necessitates the <strong>Alpha a9 III</strong> has amazing top speed of 120 fps. With Speed Boost and the C5 button, which is conveniently located near the grip on the front of the camera, users may rapidly convert their camera's continuous shooting frame rate to a quicker one to ensure their next photo is perfect. Photographers will be able to choose frame rates of up to 120 fps.</p><h3>Enhanced Functionality and Usability</h3><p>A voice memo function offers crisper recordings with a microphone placed near to the user. These notes may be transmitted via FTP and converted to text with Sony's Transfer &amp; Tagging tool. IPTC metadata may be automatically applied to photos, and up to 20 presets can be stored. Image bursts may now be shown as a group during playback, making it easier to traverse through a shoot, particularly when using the Alpha a9 III's fastest continuous shooting rates. During filming, the built-in Wi-Fi and Ethernet may be utilized to transport data quickly across the network. </p><h2>Buy Sony Alpha A9 III Full Frame Mirrorless Camera (Only Body) from Star Tech</h2><p>In Bangladesh, you can get the original <strong>Sony Alpha A9 III Full Frame Mirrorless Camera (Only Body)</strong> From Star Tech.
