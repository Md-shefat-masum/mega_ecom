Because the file sizes are small enough to allow for speedy continuous burst shooting and lengthy video recording, this sensor is suited for ordinary photography as well as UHD 4K recording.</p><h3>DIGIC X Processor</h3><p>The EOS R10 features a DIGIC X image processor, which was borrowed from the R3, to execute a variety of high-speed activities ranging from continuous shooting to high-resolution video recording. In terms of high-speed shooting, the R10 can shoot at up to 23 frames per second with a quiet electronic shutter or 15 frames per second with a mechanical shutter, with AF and AE readings before each shot. The CPU also contributes to a wide sensitivity range of ISO 100-32000, which is extensible up to ISO 51200 for working in low-light circumstances.</p><h3>UHD 4K Video Recording</h3><p>Aside from stills, the <strong>Canon EOS R10</strong> supports high-resolution UHD 4K 8-bit recording at up to 60p utilizing a cropped piece of the sensor or at 30p using an oversampled 6K recording area for increased sharpness, moiré reduction, and noise reduction. In addition, 120p recording at up to Full HD quality is enabled for slow-motion playback.</p><img src=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/image/catalog/camera/dslr-camera/canon/eos-r10/eos-r10-002.jpg\" alt=\"Canon EOS R10 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Only Body)\" width=\"920\" height=\"450\"><h3>Dual Pixel CMOS AF II</h3><p>The sophisticated Dual Pixel CMOS AF II technology, carried over from the EOS R3, boasts 651 automated AF points that cover the whole sensor area for quicker, more responsive, and more precise focusing performance. This phase-detection focusing technology also features improved subject identification and tracking, with the capacity to distinguish people, animals, and vehicles intelligently, and tracking will automatically lock onto these targets and retain tight focus throughout burst images. </p><h3>Intuitive Construction</h3><p>For high-resolution eye-level viewing of EOS R10, a bright, crisp 2.36m-dot OLED electronic viewfinder is included. This 0.95x finder benefits from rapid processing with practically no latency, and a speedy 120-fps refresh rate may be set for vivid, realistic motion depiction. A 3.0\" vari-angle LCD is also available, which allows you to operate at high, low, and front-facing angles. A touchscreen interface complements the versatile posture, and the excellent 1.04m-dot resolution provides for vivid playback and live view monitoring.</p><h3>Flexible Connectivity</h3><p>There are both wired and wireless networking options, allowing for different means of transmitting photographs and movies as well as remotely managing the camera. Physically, the EOS R10 camera has a USB Type-C port, a micro-HDMI port, and a 3.5mm microphone port for video recording.

Its 24.3MP CMOS sensor and EXPEED 6 engine enable wide sensitivity to ISO 51200, fast shooting at 4.5 fps, and UHD 4K video at 30 fps. A stylish but adaptable physical design that incorporates a magnesium alloy chassis with a weather-sealed construction to suit working adverse conditions goes hand in hand with the sensor and CPU. A back 3.2\" 1.04m-dot tilting touchscreen LCD allows for working from high and low angles, and a high-resolution 3.6m-dot OLED electronic viewfinder enables high-res eye-level viewing. Additionally, for simple sharing, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth operate with the Nikon SnapBridge software to wirelessly transmit photographs and movies and remotely manage the camera.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">UHD 4K Video Recording</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The Nikon Z5 can record UHD 4K video at up to 30 frames per second and Full HD video at up to 60 frames per second. Movie files can be saved to in-camera memory cards or an optional external recorder via HDMI out. In comparison to Full HD recording, UHD 4K recording uses a 1.7x crop of the center of the frame. Additionally, because a finished UHD 4K video file can be created directly from the camera, in-camera time-lapse photography is also possible.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Sensor-Shift Vibration Reduction</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">A 5-axis sensor-shift vibration reduction (VR) mechanism that can compensate for up to five stops of stabilization, independent of the lens being used, is built into the body. When using the extra FTZ Adapter, which is required for 3-axis stabilization, this system also functions with modified lenses. Electronic VR is another tool that helps with video recording and makes it possible to shoot with a handheld camera while maintaining steady footage.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Large 3.2\" 1.04m-dot LCD screen and&nbsp;3.69m-dot Electronic Finder</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">For bright, clear, and vivid image playback and live view shooting, a large 3.2\" 1.04m-dot LCD screen is available. The screen is touchscreen and has a tilting design to accommodate working at high and low angles. This allows for more intuitive operation, navigation, and setting control.&nbsp;A 3.69m-dot electronic finder is present for comfortable eye-level viewing.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Dual UHS-II SD card slots</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">There are two UHS-II SD card slots on the Nikon Z5 Full Frame Mirrorless Digital Camera. Use them in conjunction to separate file types like RAW and JPEG or stills and videos, as well as for automatic backup and overflow storage.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Built-in SnapBridge connectivity</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">Built-in SnapBridge connectivity allows for remote shooting and the seamless transfer of low-resolution images. A smart device and the camera can communicate using BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) and Wi-Fi. The mobile device can also remotely trigger the shutter and show a live view image from the camera to enable working from a distance.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Approximately 470 shots per charge</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The included EN-EL15c rechargeable lithium-ion battery has a capacity of 470 shots on a single charge, and in-camera USB charging is supported even when the camera is in use. In order to extend the amount of time that can be spent shooting, it is also compatible with the optional MB-N10 multi-battery power pack.</p><h2 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Buy Nikon Z5 Full Frame Mirrorless Digital Camera&nbsp;from the best Camera Shop in BD</h2><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">In Bangladesh, you can get an original <a href=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/nikon-z5-mirrorless-digital-camera\" target=\"\">Nikon Z5 Full Frame Mirrorless Digital Camera</a> From Star Tech.

It has a dependable build and enough performance to boost creativity. This camera is an excellent companion for recording ordinary moments as well as once-in-a-lifetime adventures, thanks to its proven sensor design, quick and precise AF performance, and smart operability.</p><h3>24.2MP APS-C Exmor CMOS Sensor</h3><p>The 24.2MP Exmor CMOS sensor in the APS-C size of Sony A6400 produces smooth, nuanced picture quality with minimum noise and great sensitivity from ISO 100-32000, which can be increased to ISO 102400 for working in low-light circumstances. The sensor has a one-of-a-kind design that makes use of thin copper wire, increased circuit processing, and an improved front-end LSI to improve light-gathering capacities, minimize noise, and raise readout rates for video recording.</p><h3>BIONZ X Processor</h3><p>The sensor and BIONZ X processing combination of Sony <strong>A6400</strong> also provides a peak continuous-shooting rate of 11 frames per second with AF and AE, or up to 8 frames per second with a quiet shutter, as well as 14-bit raw file output for a wide tone and color range.</p><h3>UHD 4K Video Recording in XAVC S Format</h3><p>The ZV-E10 provides full configurable color and gamma settings, allowing users to modify the gamma, black level, knee, color level, and more. For more post-production versatility, use the same S-Log2 Gamma Curve used on high-end Sony Cinema cameras, which squeezes up to 1300% more dynamic range into the video output than typical Rec. 709. Along with the BT.2020 color space, HLG (Hybrid Log-Gamma) support is available for recording within a wide color gamut, and, in addition to S-Log2, S-Log3 is also available for producing an effective 14-stop dynamic range with increased grading control in the image shadow to mid-tone regions.  The feature of Sony A6400 4K video recording also allows for the creation of 8MP stills during playback by capturing a frame from a movie and saving it as a separate file.</p><h3>4D FOCUS</h3><p>The Sony A6400 has a strong 4D FOCUS system which contains 425 on-chip phase-detection points as well as 425 contrast-detection regions for perfect focusing in as little as 0.02 seconds, covering practically the full sensor surface. This hybrid AF system's density of focusing points also enables High-density Tracking AF Technology, which is capable of tracking moving subjects in a range of lighting situations.</p><h3>Body Design and Connectivity</h3><p>The Tru-Finder 2.36m-dot OLED electronic viewfinder provides a bright, high-resolution mode of monitoring at eye level. To accommodate working from high and low angles, a 3.0\" 921.6k-dot LCD touchscreen may be rotated 180° upward or 74° downward. The Sony <strong>A6400</strong> camera screen also has White Magic technology with an RGBW pixel layout for greater brightness and usage in daytime. The touchscreen design provides access to Touch Focus control for instant focus point selection, as well as a Touchpad feature that allows you to pick a focus point on the screen while looking through the viewfinder.</p><h3>Image Stabilization and Autofocus</h3><p>When shooting handheld with shorter shutter rates, optical Steady Shot image stabilization of Sony A6400 helps to decrease the impression of camera wobble for better pictures. This stabilization technique can also be used with sensor-shift image stabilization on some cameras for more effective control of camera blur. Linear autofocus motor enables accurate and silent focusing when shooting movies and delivers rapid and precise autofocus performance. The dedicated AF/MF switch enables rapid switching between focusing systems.</p><h3>Optical Design</h3><p>The Sony A6400 camera has two extra-low dispersion elements aid in the reduction of color fringing and chromatic aberrations, resulting in enhanced clarity and color accuracy. One aspherical element aids in the management of distortion and the reduction of spherical aberrations, resulting in higher clarity and precise depiction. When using selective focus techniques, the rounded seven-blade diaphragm adds to a beautiful bokeh effect.</p><h3>Sony E 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 OSS Lens</h3><p>The <strong>Sony E 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 OSS lens</strong> of Sony A6400 is a flexible 27-202.5mm equivalent zoom for APS-C-format E-mount mirrorless cameras with a handy wide-angle to medium telephoto range. This well-rounded lens is well-suited to operating in a range of scenarios, making it a perfect zoom for travel applications, and the image stabilization reduces the impression of camera shake for better picture while shooting handheld.</p><h2>Buy Sony A6400 Mirrorless Camera With 18-135mm Lens from Star Tech</h2><p>In Bangladesh, you can get the original <strong>Sony A6400 Mirrorless Camera With 18-135mm Lens</strong> From Star Tech.

Furthermore, the low-luminance limit of this autofocus technology focuses down to a remarkable -6.5 EV for precise focusing in low-light circumstances.</p><h3>HDR PQ and Canon Log 3</h3><p>Though the EOS R8 camera can capture amazing video right out of the box, content producers wishing to take the next step in their imaging journey may choose between two powerful video recording options: HDR PQ or Canon Log 3 video recording. HDR PQ recording produces a 10-bit color file that does not require any modification. This 10-bit HDR file is compatible with HDR displays such as TVs, monitors, and smartphones, which provide more color accuracy and dynamic range than regular displays. Canon Log 3 is also accessible for artists who want to modify their video files, providing a 10-bit log file that enables for dramatic highlight and shadow recovery as well as creative color grading.</p><h3>Livestreaming</h3><p>The <strong>EOS R8</strong> UVC/UAC compatibility allows it to be used as a web camera to stream live video in Full HD to applications such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Skype, and similar video conferencing software. The full-frame image sensor allows for exposure versatility as well as strong background separation when using bright aperture lenses for video conferencing or livestreaming content.</p><h3>Movie Digital IS</h3><p>With Movie Digital IS 5-axis image stabilization of EOS R8, you may record steady films with minimal equipment, even while filming handheld. When utilizing an RF lens with optical image stabilization, coordinated management of Movie Digital IS reduces camera-shake vibrations even more. </p><h3>Flexible Connectivity</h3><p>Wired and wireless communication options enable different means of sharing photographs and movies, as well as livestreaming and remotely operating the camera. The camera has a remote port, a USB-C connector, a micro-HDMI port, a microphone input, and a headphone jack for sound monitoring. The camera's built-in Bluetooth connection allows you to effortlessly link it to compatible smart devices using the free Canon Camera link app. This low-energy wireless connection conserves battery life while allowing remote camera operation. It also delivers continually updated GPS position data from your phone, allowing you to geotag your photos so you know exactly where you took them.</p><h3>Tough, Durable Construction</h3><p>Dual CFexpress Type B memory card slots provide flexible file storing while also promoting high-speed reading and writing to keep up with the quick continuous shooting and high-resolution 8K video recording. Both slots are also XQD memory card compatible.The Z9 is designed for professional use, with an ergonomic form factor and a vertical grip for simple transitioning between horizontal and vertical shooting configurations.</p><h3>Versatile Connectivity</h3><p>Matching the professional build quality of <strong>EOS R8</strong>, the Z9 is fitted with a variety of connectivity options.

Breakthroughs in mechanical packaging and structural design have brought no-compromise full-frame camera performance to a new size and weight class that’s made for powerfully simple still and movie content creation.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Expressiveness only possible with a full-frame sensor</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The Sony Alpha 7C has A 35-mm full-frame image sensor that is about 30x larger than a 1/2.3-type smartphone sensor and even 2.3x larger than an APS-C sensor. Capturing significantly more light, it opens up new creative possibilities through a wider dynamic range, less noise, and higher perceived resolution. Deep bokeh, using shallow depth of field, is also possible in combination with a bright (wide-aperture) full-frame lens.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Faithfully capture what you see</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The Sony Alpha 7C has a back-illuminated Exmor R CMOS sensor and BIONZ X image processing engine that work together beautifully. The extra-large pixels of a 24.2-megapixel10 full-frame sensor collects more light, for a 15-stop11 wide dynamic range and smoother gradations from shadows to highlights. Excellent subjective resolution and reduced noise pair with precise color reproduction for beautifully accurate skin tones and natural textures.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Stunning bokeh, enabled by a full-frame sensor</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">Bokeh is the selective focus with a blurred background that makes the subject stand out. Portraits or close-ups are enhanced with new meaning and depth. The α7C, with its full-frame sensor, can achieve bokeh when a smaller sensor-size camera with the same f-stop lens might not. When paired with over 50 lenses available from Sony, the α7C becomes an excellent choice for creative photographic composition and movie creation.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Impressive low-light images</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The Sony Alpha 7C Compact camera With its large pixel size, in dimly lit situations or at high shutter speeds, the camera takes beautiful pictures with low noise, even when in the high sensitivity range. Standard ISO is from 100 up to ISO 51200 (expandable from ISO 50 to ISO 20480012). Noise reduction is designed to be particularly effective in the common mid-sensitivity range to faithfully reveal textures and detail in shadows.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Express yourself with E-mount lenses</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">Over 50 Sony E-mount lenses enable broad creative expression, and a full-frame sensor allows you to leverage the full capabilities of Sony lenses. From wide angles to enhanced creative compression effects on telephoto lenses, with the full-frame α7C, the possibilities are endless.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Continuous focus on active subjects</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">When you're tracking a fast-moving subject, the camera can utilize built-in AI-based Real-time Tracking16. This subject recognition algorithm draws on color, pattern (brightness), subject distance (depth), and face/eye information to recognize and hold onto your subject.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Activate Real-time Tracking anytime, with the AF-ON button</h3><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">When the focus mode is AF-S, AF-A, AF-C, or DMF, Real-time Tracking can now be activated by the AF-ON button. This is a convenient way to capture moving subjects in snapshots even with the focus mode set to AF-S. Being able to initiate Real-time Tracking simply with a thumb press anytime under AF modes expands your shooting possibilities.</div><p></p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Autofocus works when it is getting dark</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The Sony Alpha 7C Compact<a href=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/camera/camera-dslr\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> camera </a>has Advanced algorithms that contribute to high autofocus and distance measurement precision even at light levels as low as EV-422 in the AF-S mode, allowing for shots with precise AF even when scenes are dark.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Take 4K movies to a higher level</h3><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Sony Alpha 7C Compact camera with Enjoy shooting movies with depth of field control, beautiful bokeh, and clean low-light scenes only possible with a full-frame sensor. The α7C shoots 4K (QFHD: 3840×2160) using full-pixel readout and 6K oversampling, for exceptional detail with minimal moiré and jaggies23.</div><p></p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">In-camera high-speed, slow-motion effects</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">It's easy to create movies in-camera at frame rates from 1 to 120/100 fps for up to 60x quick motion and 5x slow motion in Full HD resolution26. Turn everyday motion into extraordinary artistic moments with ease, to add drama and excitement to your movies.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Clear digital audio recording</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"> The Sony Alpha 7C Compact camera supports a digital audio interface through the camera’s Multi-Interface (MI) Shoe. A digital microphone like the ECM-B1M Shotgun Microphone or XLR-K3M XLR Adaptor Kit provides clear digital audio for all kinds of movie recording, enhancing the sound to match the image. Like other MI shoe accessories, no cables or batteries are required, providing unrestrained freedom for movie-making.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Easy vlogging with a cable-free shooting grip</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The Sony Alpha 7C Compact Mirrorless Camera is ideal for high-quality imaging during travel and vlogging. For easy one-handed shooting the GP-VPT2BT grip, via wireless Bluetooth connection, puts key camera functions including zoom, record, and shutter controls in easy reach and even converts to a mini-tripod. Match it with the ECM-B1M microphone for a compact, cable-free vlogging system.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Bright and easy LCD monitor</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The side-opening, vari-angle LCD monitor is intuitive to use, rotating 176° horizontally and 270° vertically. The large touch-sensitive screen, with approximately 921 thousand dots29, provides optimum visibility even in bright outdoor light. You can frame your shot or selfie from virtually any position and angle for both stills and movies. Touch Tracking, Touch Focus, and Touch Shutter are all supported.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">For still-image photographers</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">A clear view of images in any environment is possible because the viewfinder is properly equipped despite the body’s compact size. The 2.35 million-dot29 XGA OLED Tru-Finder™ electronic viewfinder achieves high contrast and faithful tonal reproduction for fine subject detail display. A smoother image with 120/100fps30 frame rate makes it easy to track moving subjects. To enhance the user experience, the grip hold and shape have been carefully designed, so that compactness and usability are both.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Small and lightweight, yet robust and reliable</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">Magnesium alloy used for the top, front, and rear covers enhances body durability. For the α7C, camera parts and internal structures were carefully optimized to reduce size and weight. On the one hand, a monocoque structure31 patterned after an airplane design helps to reduce weight while increasing strength, realizing a lightweight camera body with rigid flexibility. And on the other, the shape is supremely ergonomic and also weather-sealed against dust and moisture32 for comfortable and confident shooting in a wide range of conditions.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Take more shots and shoot longer</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">Despite the compact body, the high-capacity NP-FZ100 battery provides power to capture up to an industry-leading33 740 images34 on a full charge when using the LCD monitor, or 68034 when using the viewfinder.

Engineered to work seamlessly with RF lenses, the EOS RP also maintains complete compatibility with EF and EF-S lenses by using one of three optional Mount Adapters. When using EF-S lenses, the EOS RP even crops automatically to reflect the APS-C sized sensor the lenses are designed for. The EOS RP camera features a Canon-developed and produced 35mm full-frame CMOS sensor with approx. 26.2 effective megapixels. It employs the DIGIC 8 Image Processor to enhance the speed of operations across the board. This means fast, efficient performance and phenomenal image quality for big prints. The EOS RP camera's highly responsive Dual Pixel CMOS AF system features 4,779 manually selectable AF points** and can deliver sharp focus within approximately 0.05 seconds***. This means fast action can be captured and focus can be maintained with speed, accuracy and ease. Amazing for nighttime photography or in very low light, the EOS RP camera's brilliant AF can operate in light as dim as a light rating of EV -5^ where other AF systems may fail or search. Phenomenal AF is achieved even when using lenses with high F numbers. This ultra-sensitive AF works in concert with the EOS RP's EVF to clearly capture subjects even when there's limited light. Among the EOS RP camera's manual focus aids, Focus Peaking helps establish the focus area quickly and clearly. With manual focus peaking, the outline of the area in focus is indicated by a colored line. Focus Peaking is usable in conjunction with the EOS RP's Focus Guide feature, and can be customized with peaking color and detection level specifications that fit the project at hand. The EOS RP camera features a high-precision 0.39-inch OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode) EVF with approx. 2.36 million dots and a 22mm eyepoint. The electronic viewfinder (EVF) has been created to provide a bright, sharp and colorful 100% view of the subject at hand. Equipped with an aspherical lens, the EVF shows a crisp and vivid image with minimal distortion, even when the eye moves off the center of the visual field. The EOS RP EVF has a bright, 22mm-high eyepoint design that creates a generous 30mm space between your nose and the rear of the viewfinder. This makes it easy to compose and view images in the viewfinder with or without glasses. The EVF's 0.39-inch OLED based display features approximately 2.36 million dots for an incredibly sharp and detailed image that makes it easy to check focus and view the extensive image data that's displayed. The EOS RP camera features a 3.0-inch, 1.04 Megapixel Clear View LCD II Vari-angle Touchscreen LCD. Brightness is adjustable in seven levels. Its extensive flexibility makes it easy to compose and shoot from virtually any angle, making selfies simple and enabling the LCD to fold away when not in use. The brightness of the EVF and the LCD monitor can even be adjusted individually - a first for an EOS camera. Touchscreen features include settings, review and even AF point selection.<br></p>","specifications":[{"heading":"Image Sensor","values":[{"key":"Sensor Type","value":"CMOS sensor (compatible with Dual Pixel CMOS AF)"},{"key":"Effective pixels","value":"Approx. 30.3 megapixels"},{"key":"Aspect Ratio","value":"3:2 (Horizontal:Vertical)"}]},{"heading":"Focus","values":[{"key":"Focus Mode","value":"One-Shot AF"},{"key":"AF Point","value":"Max. 5,655"}]},{"heading":"Exposure Control","values":[{"key":"Metering Modes","value":"Evaluative metering (AF point-linked)"},{"key":"ISO Sensitivity","value":"Normal ISO 100 - 40000 (in 1/3-stop or whole-stop increments)"}]},{"heading":"Shutter","values":[{"key":"Shutter Speed","value":"1/8000 to 30 sec., bulb (total range of all shooting modes)"}]},{"heading":"LCD Monitor","values":[{"key":"Type","value":"TFT color, liquid-crystal monitor"},{"key":"Viewing Angle","value":"Approx. 100% vertically/horizontally"}]},{"heading":"Shooting","values":[{"key":"Color Space","value":"Selectable between sRGB and Adobe RGB"}]},{"heading":"File Type","values":[{"key":"Image Type","value":"EXIF 2.3 (DCF2.0)"},{"key":"Image Size","value":"3:2 Aspect Ratio"},{"key":"Movie Type","value":"MP4"},{"key":"Movie Size","value":"4K (UHD)"}]},{"heading":"Storage","values":[{"key":"Storage Type","value":"SD/SDHC/SDXC memory cards"}]},{"heading":"Flash","values":[{"key":"Built-in Flash","value":"No"},{"key":"External Flash Compatibility","value":"The camera can set the following with EX series Speedlites:"}]},{"heading":"Power Source","values":[{"key":"Battery","value":"Battery Pack LP-E6N (or LP-E6) x 1"}]},{"heading":"Physical Specification","values":[{"key":"Dimensions (W x H x D)","value":"Approx. 5.35 x 3.87 x 3.32 in. / 135.8 x 98.3 x 84.4mm"},{"key":"Weight (Body Only)","value":"Approx. 1.46 lbs. / 660g (including battery, SD memory card; without body cap)"}]},{"heading":"Other Features","values":[{"key":"Features","value":"CMOS sensor (compatible with Dual Pixel CMOS AF)"}]},{"heading":"Lens","values":[{"key":"Maximum Aperture","value":"f/4"}]},{"heading":"Warranty Information","values":[{"key":"Warranty","value":"03 Years Service Warranty (No parts warranty)"}]}],"latest_price":{"heading":"What is the price of Canon EOS R DSLR Camera Body in Bangladesh?","paragraph":"The latest price of Canon EOS R DSLR Camera Body in Bangladesh is 156,500৳.

A software upgrade is now available to support Sony's new Real-time Eye AF for Animals. The feature works by automatically detecting and tracking the eyes of animals that you're photographing, for beautiful pet portraits and wildlife shots. With outstanding imaging capability and high-speed performance contained in a compact body, the Î±7 III gives you the power, precision, and flexibility to capture once-in-a-lifetime moments just as you like. A newly developed back-illuminated image sensor and evolved image processing system fulfill various shooting needs with high-quality imaging capabilities that you would expect only of a full-frame camera. A new version of the 24.2-megapixel Exmor R CMOS sensor, now featuring a back-illuminated structure, is combined with the latest BIONZ X image processing engine and front-end LSI, and this combination achieves a data readout speed that is two times faster and data processing capability that is 1.8 times higher. The 35-mm full-frame CMOS image sensor with back-illuminated structure enhances light collection efficiency, expands circuitry scale, and, with the help of a copper wiring layer that contributes to quicker data transfer, outputs data at very high speed, while minimizing noise to reveal fine details in every picture. Standard ISO range is extended to ISO 100-51200 (expandable to ISO 50-204800 for stills), while Detail Reproduction and Area-specific Noise Reduction technologies maintain image details and cut noise. With highly effective performance in mid-to-high sensitivity ranges, you can shoot at high ISO with no concerns about noise or image deterioration. The latest high-precision stabilization uses stabilization unit and gyro sensors and algorithms to achieve a 5.0-step shutter speed advantage in a system that compensates five types of camera shake with a wide range of lenses and delivers excellent performance. For smoother, more natural gradation, the latest BIONZ X image processor and front-end LSI process image signals in 16-bit form.

The a7R 4th generation has an upgraded 61MP sensor, quicker processing, enhanced AF performance, and a more well-rounded feature set for both high-end picture and video applications. The newly built full-frame 61MP Exmor R CMOS sensor with a back-illuminated architecture gives amazing resolution with great clarity, low noise, and a broad 15-stop dynamic range. The shape of the sensor supports exceptional picture quality, and a copper wire layer substantially boosts data transfer speed for capturing 14-bit, high-resolution 61MP stills with a base sensitivity range of ISO 100-32000, which can be increased to ISO 50-102400.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">BIONZ X Image Processor</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Sony a7R IVA Mirrorless Camera's BIONZ X engine's high-speed image processing enables the quick continuous shooting, 4K video recording, and improved AF tracking. The rapid processing also aids in the reduction of rolling shutter and other motion aberrations for the clear portrayal of moving subjects. In terms of shooting rates, the sensor and CPU enable up to 10 fps shooting at full resolution for up to 68 consecutive frames, with full-time AF/AE.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Pixel Shift Multi Shooting</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This unique compositing mode allows you to achieve even greater resolution than the 61MP sensor affords. Working in conjunction with the sensor-shift image stabilization, this mode shifts the sensor while making 16 consecutive exposures to acquire approximately 240.8MP of information for greater color accuracy and detail than possible with a single exposure, along with an impressive image size of 19,008 x 12,672 pixels. These files can then be merged during post-production by using the Sony Imaging software suite.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Fast Hybrid AF System</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">An updated Fast Hybrid AF system now employs a combination of 567 phase-detection points, which cover approximately 99.7% of the height and 74% of the width of the frame, along with 425 contrast-detection areas for reliable and quick autofocus and subject tracking performance. This focusing system also achieves especially quick speed and reliable tracking, as well as enhanced low-light focusing response down to -3 EV. The apt focus system also lends itself to a variety of focusing functions for refined accuracy, including Lock-on AF, which maintains focus on moving subjects throughout the use of a configurable frame that is set over the desired moving subject and Expand Flexible Spot, which employs neighboring focus points to retain focus on moving subjects even if the originally selected point loses focus. Additionally, Eye AF can be used to base focus on recognized human subjects' eyes for portraits and is available in both AF-S and AF-C modes, for both stills and video. Eye AF can be used when photographing animal subjects, too, with any focusing mode when shooting stills. Autofocus can also be used in conjunction with the Focus Magnifier function for critical focus when homing in on minute subject details. The rear touchscreen can also be used for Touch Focus control, and a Touchpad Focus Control mode lets you use the rear screen intuitively while keeping your eye on the viewfinder.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">5-Axis SteadyShot INSIDE Image Stabilization</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Sony a7R IVA includes a 5.5-stop effective 5-axis SteadyShot INSIDE image stabilization technology that adjusts for five different forms of camera shaking experienced during handheld stills and video shooting. This enables users to comfortably utilize any lens, even adapted lenses, for important images without experiencing blur caused by camera motion. The device will compensate for pitch and yaw modifications for extended focal lengths. The incorporation of horizontal and vertical shift correction, on the other hand, will assist macro and high-magnification pictures. The roll adjustment will be useful for all shooting techniques. Even when using third-party lenses and adapters or lenses with built-in optical stabilization, all 5 axes of stabilization will operate at all times.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">UHD 4K Video Recording in XAVC S Format</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Sony a7R IVA Mirrorless Camera has Internal recording of UHD 4K movies is supported at several frame rates up to 30 fps and, based on the Super35mm recording area and effective 6K resolution, oversampling produces additional detail and complete pixel readout is feasible, allowing for a higher quality picture with decreased moiré and aliasing. Full-frame 4K recording has also been significantly enhanced for increased quality while working at mid to high sensitivities, allowing full utilization of the sensor width. Full HD 1080p recording at frame rates up to 120 fps is also possible, and both resolutions use the 100 Mbps XAVC S codec housed behind an MP4 wrapper with 4:2:0 sampling. The 120 fps recording speed also allows for 4x and 5x slow-motion video recording at 30p or 24p frame rates. Uncompressed HDMI output permits the use of an optional external recorder for clean 4K recording with 4:2:2 sampling in addition to high-resolution internal recording. 4K video recording also allows for the creation of 8MP stills during playback by capturing a frame from a movie and saving it as a separate file.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Body Design and Connectivity</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">An upgraded UXGA OLED Tru-Finder EVF with a 5.76m-dot resolution is included, and a dedicated High-quality preset offers a 120 fps refresh rate for extremely smooth playback of moving subjects. In addition to the EVF, a 3.0\" 2.36m-dot rear LCD with a touch panel design is provided for simple operation and focusing adjustment. In addition, the screen tilts upward 107° and downward 41° to facilitate working from high and low angles. While staying lightweight, the magnesium alloy chassis ensures stiffness, longevity, and stability. The lens attachment has also been modified to help accommodate heavier lenses, as has the grip stiffness for more comfortable hand-holding. Extensive weather-sealing has been used to withstand dust and moisture for dependable operation in extreme weather situations, including increased sealing around the battery cover, terminal cover, and chassis joints. The a7R IVA's battery life is rated at roughly 530 shots per charge with the EVF or 660 shots with the rear LCD, using the same NP-FZ100 battery as its predecessor. Dual SD memory card slots provide versatile file storage and processing, and may be set to divide raw and JPEG files or to record overflow data. Both of the card slots are rated to support UHS-II memory cards for faster transfer speeds. Integrated PC sync terminal for wired flash sync with strobe packs or wireless radio remotes. A USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-C port has been added, in addition to a micro-USB port, for faster, more reliable tethering support. The USB Type-C connection allows the camera to be charged from the host power source while connected. Updated Multi Interface Shoe supports working with the optional ECM-B1M Shotgun Microphone or XLR-K3M XLR Adapter Kit, which provide improved, clear audio recording sound by sending a digital audio signal to the camera, opposed to an analog signal. In addition, the a7R IVA has a 3.5mm microphone input connector for use with external microphones.

The device will compensate for pitch and yaw modifications for extended focal lengths. The incorporation of horizontal and vertical shift correction, on the other hand, will assist macro and high-magnification pictures. The roll adjustment will be useful for all shooting techniques. Even when using third-party lenses and adapters or lenses with built-in optical stabilization, all 5 axes of stabilization will operate at all times. Additionally, specifically for video, there is also an Active IS mode that adds even more precise stabilization methods for even smoother footage straight out of the camera.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Body Design and Connectivity</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">A stunning QXGA OLED Tru-Finder EVF with a high 9.44m-dot resolution and 0.9x magnification provide extraordinarily bright, crisp, and detailed eye-level viewing. This viewfinder boasts a dedicated 120 fps High-Quality option for smooth motion rendering, as well as a long 25mm eye point, 41° field of vision, and a fluorine coating on the outermost viewfinder element to aid in cleaning. A side-opening 3.0\" 1.44m-dot vari-angle articulating screen helps work from high and low angles as well as a front-facing position for vlogging or other self-recording purposes, which is a first for a7-series cameras. This LCD also has a touchscreen for easy shooting control and menu navigation. The redesigned menu layout is more user-friendly and compliments having separate processes and settings options for video recording and still photography. The menu system also works in tandem with the back LCD's touchscreen design.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Ports and Connectivity</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The Sony Alpha 7S III Mirrorless Full-frame Camera features a Full-size HDMI A connector, which provides a more dependable connection for dealing with external recorders. A USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-C connector, in addition to a micro-USB port, has been added for speedier, more reliable tethering capability. The USB Type-C connector allows the camera to be charged or operated from the host power supply while attached. Both the 3.5mm headphone and external microphone connectors provide more control over audio recording. It contains a Multi Interface Shoe that allows it to function with the optional ECM-B1M Shotgun Microphone or XLR-K3M XLR Adapter Kit, which enables better, clearer audio recording sound by providing a digital audio signal to the camera rather than an analog signal. This camera's built-in Wi-Fi offers remote camera control and rapid image sharing to mobile devices for direct internet sharing, and compatibility for both the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands permits wireless tethered shooting. This connection also allows for remote camera operation.

It features a newly developed 45MP CMOS sensor, 8K raw video recording, 12 fps continuous shooting with a mechanical shutter, and is the first EOS camera to feature 5-axis sensor-shift image stabilization. In addition to the image assets, the R5, despite its redesigned design, feels familiar to EOS 5-series customers. A very high-resolution 0.5\" 5.76m-dot electronic viewfinder provides a realistic 120 fps refresh rate, while the 3.2\" rear touchscreen LCD panel has a vari-angle design to satisfy vlogging demands and benefit working from high and low angles. A top status LCD allows for an easy workflow, and the camera includes two memory card slots—one CFexpress Type B and one SD UHS-II—as well as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi wireless connection.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/image/catalog/camera/dslr-camera/canon/eos-r5/eos-r5-003.jpg\" alt=\"Canon EOS R5 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Only Body)\" width=\"920\" height=\"450\"><h3>IBIS High Resolution 400MP Files</h3>\n<p>The IBIS High Resolution shot option on the EOS R5 with firmware 1.8.1 or later may produce 400 megapixel (approx.) files in-camera without the need for additional software. This capability is useful in instances when a high-resolution file with fine detail is required. Art replication and architectural signs are two examples.</p>\n<h3>45MP Full-Frame Sensor and DIGIC X Processor</h3>\n<p>The EOS R5 is built on a newly designed 45MP full-frame CMOS sensor and delivers both high-resolution stills and video output, with the fine-tuned DIGIC X image processor providing a wealth of speed. The ISO 100-51200 sensitivity range, which can be raised to ISO 102400, is perfect for working in a variety of lighting circumstances, while rapid continuous shooting at up to 12 frames per second with a mechanical shutter or quiet 20 frames per second with an electronic shutter is great for dealing with moving subjects.</p>\n<h3>8K30 Raw and 4K120 Video Recording</h3>\n<p>The 45MP full-frame sensor of EOS R5 allows for astonishingly high-resolution DCI 8K 30 fps raw video recording internally, as well as 4K recording up to 120 fps in 4:2:2 10-bit with Canon Log. HDR-PQ recording is also supported, as well as in-camera HDR creation and external recording via the HDMI connector, which provides a crisp 4K output at up to 60 frames per second. There are choices for both All-I and IPB compression, as well as Dual Pixel CMOS AF when shooting at up to 8K raw.</p>\n<h3>HDMI 8K Raw Output to Atomos Ninja V+</h3>\n<p>Firmware update 1.4.0 adds the ability to output 8K30, 10-bit footage to the Atomos Ninja V+ recorder via an optional HDMI connection for ProRes raw recording. (Please keep in mind that the recorder may grow heated.)</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/image/catalog/camera/dslr-camera/canon/eos-r5/eos-r5-002.jpg\" alt=\"Canon EOS R5 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Only Body)\" width=\"920\" height=\"450\"><h3>Body Design and Wireless Connectivity</h3>\n<p>The EOS R5 has five-axis sensor-shift image stabilization, a first for EOS cameras, that adjusts for up to an amazing eight stops of camera motion for genuinely effective compensation of camera shake for handheld photography with slower shutter speeds. This stabilization technology is also compatible with lens-based optical image stabilization for both original RF and modified EF lenses.</p>\n<h3>Dual Pixel CMOS AF II</h3>\n<p>The upgraded Dual Pixel CMOS AF II has 1053 customizable focusing points that cover around 100% of the picture frame for wide and even coverage. This focusing technology of EOS R5 provides smooth and rapid focusing performance in the same way as a camcorder does. A Movie Servo AF option for recording video provides smooth and natural focusing when switching between objects or distances inside the picture, as well as the flexibility to select tracking sensitivity, AF speed, and Face Tracking priority. Rack focus is achieved with the Touch AF technology simply by touching parts within the scene on the touchscreen to adjust focus in an easy manner. The high-resolution 5.67m-dot 0.5\"</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/image/catalog/camera/dslr-camera/canon/eos-r5/eos-r5-001.jpg\" alt=\"Canon EOS R5 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Only Body)\" width=\"920\" height=\"450\"><h3>Body Design and Wireless Connectivity</h3>\nThe high-resolution 5.67m-dot 0.5\" electronic viewfinder is bright and crisp for eye-level viewing, and the rapid 120 fps refresh rate enables natural motion depiction for a more realistic viewfinder experience. The rear 3.2\" 2.1m-dot LCD touchscreen has a vari-angle design that advantages both front-facing filming, such as for vlogging, and working from high and low shooting angles. To rapidly examine camera and shooting settings, utilize the top status LCD. For versatile storage, CFexpress Type B and SD UHS-II memory card ports are included; the CFexpress slot is perfect for 8K video and high-speed, high-resolution burst shooting, while the SD card slot preserves a familiar form factor for wide compatibility.<p></p>\n<h2>Buy Canon EOS R5 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Only Body) from Star Tech</h2>\n<p>In Bangladesh, you can get the original Canon EOS R5 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Only Body) From Star Tech.

The Z8 is dubbed the \"ultimate hybrid camera\" because it combines the flagship's proven sensor, processor, and AF capabilities with a redesigned body design that is more suited to gimbal usage, event filming, and other handheld applications. </p><img src=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/image/catalog/camera/mirriorless/nikon/nikon-z8/z8-001.webp\" alt=\"Nikon Z8 45.7MP Mirrorless Camera(Only Body)\" width=\"920\" height=\"450\"><h3>45.7MP Stacked BSI CMOS Sensor</h3><p>The 45.7MP BSI stacked CMOS sensor in FX format of Nikon Z8 provides a valuable mix of resolution, rapid readout rates, outstanding clarity, and low noise. The stacking construction helps to prevent rolling shutter, and the BSI certification provides better noise levels while operating at the upper end of the expanded ISO 32-102400 range. </p><h3>EXPEED 7 Image Processor</h3><p>The EXPEED 7 processing engine of Nikon Z8, which is about 10 times quicker than a Z7 II, complements the sensor. This engine, together with the stacked sensor architecture, results in incredibly rapid AF speeds, burst shooting rates, a large buffer capacity, smooth video performance, and snappy overall handling. Continuous shooting speeds of up to 20 frames per second in raw, 30 frames per second in JPEG, and 60 frames per second in DX. Capable of buffering over 1000 raw photos in a burst, which means raw image sequences may be captured continuously for around 50 seconds. </p><h3>493-Point Phase-Detection AF</h3><p>To provide fast and precise focusing performance, the <strong>Z8</strong> employs the trademark 493-point phase-detection AF technology. This system benefits from the Z interface's high-speed transmission as well as the sensor's speed, which allows AF measurements to occur at up to 120 fps.</p><img src=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/image/catalog/camera/mirriorless/nikon/nikon-z8/z8-002.webp\" alt=\"Nikon Z8 45.7MP Mirrorless Camera(Only Body)\" width=\"920\" height=\"450\"><h3>Subject Detection with Deep Learning Technology</h3><p>The Nikon Z8 can distinguish a wide range of unique subject categories, including persons, animals, aircraft, and bicycles. When using Auto-Area AF, these subjects will be identified, focussed on, and tracked automatically to guarantee crisp focus as the subject moves around the frame.</p><h2>Buy Nikon Z8 45.7MP Mirrorless Camera(Only Body) from Star Tech</h2><p>In Bangladesh, you can get an original <strong>Nikon Z8 45.7MP Mirrorless Camera(Only Body)</strong> From Star Tech.

Its enhanced AF performance, freshly designed sensor, and high-resolution 8K video recording are its standout features. The Nikon Z9, their first mirrorless flagship camera, is notable for being a camera that photographers and filmmakers using a range of applications will find appealing.</p><img src=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/image/catalog/camera/mirriorless/nikon/nikon-z9/z9-001.jpg\" alt=\"Nikon Z9 Mirrorless Camera(Only Body)\" width=\"920\" height=\"450\"><h3>45.7MP Stacked BSI CMOS Sensor</h3><p>The Nikon Z9 is powered by a newly built FX-format 45.7MP BSI stacked CMOS sensor. Its stacked construction provides quick readout rates and aids in rolling shutter reduction, while the BSI design adds to remarkable clarity and low noise when working at higher sensitivities. It also has a high-resolution chip (45.7MP) that helps landscape, portraiture, and other detail-oriented genres, as well as the ability to capture video at resolutions up to 8K. The full-frame BSI design is also noted for excellent color and detail reproduction, and this sensor has a native ISO range of 64-25600 that can be increased to ISO 32-102400.</p><h3>Electronic Shutter-Only Design</h3><p>The Nikon Z9 totally foregoes a mechanical shutter in favor of an electronic shutter for all capture modes, relying on the sensor's speed and stacking construction. The sensor's speed allows for up to 1/32,000 sec recording, and the layered construction eliminates motion distortion enabling realistic portrayal of fast-moving things such as golf clubs, baseball bats, and vehicles. In addition, despite the lack of a mechanical shutter, flash sync up to 1/200 sec. is available, as are high speed sync features.</p><h3>493-Point Phase-Detection AF</h3><p>The <strong>Nikon Z9</strong> employs a 493-point phase-detection AF system that covers the whole sensor area to achieve fast and accurate focusing performance. This system benefits from the Z interface's high-speed transmission as well as the sensor's speed, which allows AF measurements to occur at up to 120 fps. This focusing technology also works in low-light circumstances, with a Starlight mode that allows focusing down to -8.5 EV, which is ideal for astrophotography, concert photography, and other nighttime shooting applications.</p><h3>Subject Detection with Deep Learning Technology</h3><p>The 3D Tracking option makes its debut in a Nikon mirrorless camera with the Nikon Z9. This popular Nikon DSLR focusing setting works in tandem with subject recognition to latch on to rapid, erratic moving subjects that move parallel and perpendicular to the camera. There are also three Dynamic-Area AF settings with varying focus area widths for capturing a wide range of moving subject types. Firmware 2.0 now includes 20 different types of custom Wide-Area AF selection patterns, 12 of which are supported during video recording, providing more precise AF and subject identification inside a specific area of the frame. </p><h3>Up to 8K Recording Supported</h3><p>In addition to its high-end photo capabilities, the Nikon Z9 is Nikon's most competent video camera, with a range of resolutions and frame rates available up to 8K. UHD 8K 30p video may be recorded using full pixel readout, with continuous filming feasible for around 2 hours and 5 minutes. Full-frame 4K recording at up to 120p for slow-motion replay is also supported. Oversampled UHD 4K recording at up to 60p is possible with an 8K area for greater sharpness and detail. In addition, high-resolution frame grabs from 8K and 4K movies may be captured in camera for 33MP or 11MP stills, respectively.</p><img src=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/image/catalog/camera/mirriorless/nikon/nikon-z9/z9-002.jpg\" alt=\"Nikon Z9 Mirrorless Camera(Only Body)\" width=\"920\" height=\"450\"><h3>ProRes and H.265 10-Bit Internal Recording</h3><p>Internal recording in ProRes 422 HQ and H.265 codecs is possible with 10-bit color and 4:2:2 sampling, while H.264 and 4:2:0 color can be utilized depending on workflow demands. There is also a 10-bit N-Log option and a Flat color profile for extra flexibility when color grading in post. Furthermore, HLG (Hybrid Log Gamma) may be utilized to create HDR-ready material directly from the camera.</p><h3>Four-Axis Tilting LCD</h3><p>The <strong>Nikon Z9</strong> has a 3.2\" 2.1m-dot four-axis tilting touchscreen LCD, a first for Nikon, which improves working from high and low angles while shooting in horizontal or vertical mode. The four-way tilting architecture of this screen enables for better viewing from a range of angles, and the user interface orientation will also change based on how the camera is handled.</p> <h3>Tough, Durable Construction</h3><p>Dual CFexpress Type B memory card slots provide flexible file storing while also promoting high-speed reading and writing to keep up with the quick continuous shooting and high-resolution 8K video recording. Both slots are also XQD memory card compatible. The Nikon Z9 is designed for professional use, with an ergonomic form factor and a vertical grip for simple transitioning between horizontal and vertical shooting configurations.</p><h3>Versatile Connectivity</h3><p>Matching the professional build quality, the <strong>Nikon Z9</strong> is fitted with a variety of connectivity options. Full-size HDMI port for video output to an external recorder or monitor. USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C port for tethering, data transmission, and in-camera battery charging. The Ethernet connector provides a 1000BASE-T wired LAN connection for FTP file transfers. The 10-pin port supports a wide range of accessories and remote connectivity. PC sync port for flash synchronization. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi (2.4 and 5 GHz) allow for wireless file transfer, remote camera control via a mobile device, and operate in conjunction with the NX Mobile Air software for file management. GNSS allows for in-camera geotagging and storage of location information while shooting.</p><h2>Buy Nikon Z9 Mirrorless Camera(Only Body) from Star Tech</h2><p>In Bangladesh, you can get an original <strong>Nikon Z9 Mirrorless Camera(Only Body)</strong> From Star Tech.

This full-frame mirrorless camera was built without cutting corners and offers high-resolution still photography, stunning 8K video recording, speed and sensitivity, and connection for the most demanding professional workflows. The α1 offers high resolution and unprecedented speed combined with sensitivity and dynamic range that can bring the creator's vision to life.<br></p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">50.1MP Full-Frame BSI CMOS Sensor and BIONZ XR</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The Sony Alpha 1 has a full-frame stacked back-illuminated CMOS Exmor RSTM sensor with integrated memory and 50.1 effective megapixels. This not only produces excellent image quality but also enables the 1 to shoot continuously at up to 30 frames per second while providing quick, accurate phase-detection AF and the first full-frame 8.6K oversampled 8K movies in the series. Outstanding performance for a brand-new era of image creation.&nbsp;has a new system design and significantly better processing speed for all phases of signal processing, starting with image acquisition. For exceptional image quality, processing latency is reduced while image processing capability is considerably improved. Regardless of the real-time processing load, quick, stress-free control response is maintained thanks to distributed processing for user interface, network, and file management.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Continuous shooting at up to 30fps</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The Sony a1 with an electronic shutter can shoot up to 165 full-frame JPEG images4 or 155 full-frame compressed RAW images5 at up to 30 frames per second3 while maintaining full AF and AE tracking performance thanks to a fast readout from the 50.1-megapixel image sensor and a sizable buffer memory. When timing is crucial for sports and other dynamic subjects, this can be a tremendous confidence booster.<br></p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Silent, vibration-free electronic shutter</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">When filming sports or events in a calm atmosphere, the electronic shutter makes no mechanical noise. A second factor in the higher image quality is the electronic shutter's lack of vibration, which reduces the possibility of vibration-induced blur. Furthermore, compared to its mechanical counterpart, the electronic shutter is far more durable because it contains no moving parts.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">High resolution and sensitivity with 15-stop dynamic range</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The&nbsp; Alpha 1's 50.1 effective megapixel image sensor produces remarkable resolution because to highly effective noise-reduction technology. In addition to high sensitivity with minimal noise and roughly 15 stops12 of dynamic range at lower sensitivity levels for smooth, natural gradations from shadows to highlights, the resolution is further enhanced by these features.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Wide sensitivity range</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The new BIONZ XR image processing engine of Sony a1 works with this sensor's high pixel count, together with its back-illuminated structure, gapless on-chip lenses, AR-coated seal glass, and other unique imaging technologies, to produce great resolution and low noise over a broad sensitivity range: Standard ISO 100-32000, extendable to ISO 50-102400.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">5-axis optical in-body image stabilization</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The Sony Alpha 1's 50.1-megapixel sensor produces high-resolution photographs with the highest possible quality thanks to a high-precision stabilization unit, gyro sensors, and enhanced image stabilization algorithms. This results in a shutter speed advantage of up to 5.5 steps. The Active Mode on the 1 also provides excellent stabilization for handheld movie filming.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">759 point full-area phase-detection AF</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">A high-density focal plane phase-detection AF system with 759 phase-detection points covers almost 92% of the image area, ensuring accuracy and unwavering focus in situations when focusing could otherwise be challenging. Together with a 425-point contrast AF system, the 759-point focal plane phase-detection AF system ensures accurate AF performance in any situation.<br></p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">8K 30p and 4K 120p Support</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">Sony Alpha 1 Mirrorless Digital Camera comes with a high-resolution sensor and quick processing capability, UHD 8K 30p XAVC HS 10-bit 4:2:2 video recording is feasible using the full width of the sensor, providing 8.6K oversampling for excellent sharpness and realism.

The X-E4 features the same 26.1MP X-Trans CMOS 4 APS-C sensor and X-Processor 4 as the flagship model, and it boasts rich color reproduction, a broad dynamic range, and an exceptional sensitivity range for working in low-light circumstances. In terms of speed, DCI/UHD 4K as well as slow-motion Full HD recording are available, and rapid continuous shooting at up to 8 fps is allowed for stills. In addition, the sensor's architecture has a hybrid autofocus technology, which combines 425 phase-detection points with a contrast-detection system for fast and precise AF performance.</p><h3>26.1MP APS-C X-Trans BSI CMOS 4 Sensor</h3><p>The APS-C-format 26.1MP X-Trans CMOS 4 sensor of FUJIFILM X-E4, which boasts a back-illuminated design for smooth tonal reproduction, increased low-light performance, and a wide native sensitivity range of ISO 160-12800, is at the heart of the X-E4. It, too, is an X-Trans sensor with a randomized pixel array, which gives a high level of picture clarity and sharpness due to the absence of an optical low-pass filter. In comparison to traditional pixel patterns, the X-Trans design more closely resembles the organic nature of film to provide subtle colors and tonal transitions while also eliminating moiré and aliasing.</p><h3>X-Processor 4</h3><p>This AF technology of <strong>FUJIFILM X-E4</strong> provides faster, more accurate focusing in a wide range of illumination settings down to -7 EV. An updated X-Processor 4 with a quad-core CPU complements the imaging and focusing capabilities, delivering faster, more responsive performance throughout the camera system, including a full-resolution 8 fps shooting rate with the mechanical shutter, a 20 fps rate with an electronic shutter, or a 30 fps rate with an electronic shutter and a 1.25x crop.</p><h3>UHD and DCI 4K Video Recording</h3><p>Beyond stills, the X-E4 has a diverse range of video capabilities, including internal DCI/UHD 4K recording at up to 30 fps and Full HD recording at up to 240 fps for super slow-motion playback. The X-Processor 4's speed improves overall video performance by enabling rapid read rates while recording video and reducing rolling shutter distortion when capturing moving subjects. A micro-HDMI connector also allows for 10-bit 4:2:2 recording to an external recorder.</p><h3>Body Design</h3><p>The 0.62x magnification of the bright, high-resolution 2.36m-dot OLED electronic viewfinder ensures clear and comfortable eye-level viewing. The touchscreen design of the tilting 3.0\" 1.62m-dot LCD of <strong>FUJIFILM X-E4</strong> allows for straightforward operation and playback, and the 180° upward tilting design greatly favors working from high and front-facing shooting angles. The top plate features a number of physical controls for quick, simple exposure tuning, including separate shutter speed and exposure compensation knobs that allow direct modification even when the camera is turned off. This exposure compensation dial also features a C position for a +/- 5 EV range when used in conjunction with the command dials. The rear joystick may be used for easy AF point selection and switching, menu navigation, and image playback.</p><h3>XF 27mm f/2.8 R WR Lens</h3><p>The very small pancake prime XF 27mm f/2.8 R WR lens of FUJIFILM X-E4 is included with the camera body. This 41mm-equivalent lens has been upgraded with a weather-sealed construction and a manual aperture ring for easy exposure control adjustment. In terms of optics, one aspherical element is used to decrease distortion and spherical aberrations, while a Super EBC coating is used to suppress flare and ghosting. A high-torque DC coreless motor is also employed to achieve rapid, precise, and near-silent focusing capability, which benefits both picture and video applications.</p><h2>Buy FUJIFILM X-E4 Mirrorless Camera with 27mm Lens Silver from Star Tech</h2><p>In Bangladesh, you can get an original <strong>FUJIFILM X-E4 Mirrorless Camera with 27mm Lens Silver</strong> From Star Tech.

Using a known and highly-regarded APS-C-format 26.1MP X-Trans CMOS 4 sensor, the X-T4 is capable of high-resolution recording as well as support for DCI/UHD 4K video at 60 fps, Full HD recording up to 240 fps, ISO 160-12800 sensitivity, and mechanical shutter continuous shooting up to 15 fps. The sensor's BSI design reduces noise and improves overall clarity, and it is combined with the X-Processor 4 for quick performance and responsiveness. The sensor's architecture also allows for a hybrid autofocus system, which combines 425 phase-detection points with a contrast-detection system to provide fast and precise AF performance. In addition, the X-T4 includes a 6.5 stop-effective sensor-shift image stabilization technology to lessen the appearance of camera shake with practically any attached lens.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">26.1MP APS-C X-Trans BSI CMOS 4 Sensor and X-Processor 4</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The APS-C-format 26.1MP X-Trans CMOS 4 sensor, which boasts a back-illuminated design for smooth tonal reproduction, increased low-light performance, and a broad native sensitivity range of ISO 160-12800, is at the heart of the X-T4. It, too, is an X-Trans sensor with a randomized pixel array, which gives a high level of picture clarity and sharpness due to the absence of an optical low-pass filter. In comparison to traditional pixel patterns, the X-Trans design more closely resembles the organic nature of film to provide subtle colors and tonal transitions while eliminating moiré and aliasing.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">In-Body Image Stabilization</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The FUJIFILM X-T4 Mirrorless Digital Camera's built-in 5-axis sensor-shift image stabilization reduces the appearance of camera shaking by up to 6.5 stops. This technology works with most X Series lenses, including non-stabilized ones, and benefits working with slower shutter speeds and shooting in low-light circumstances. Additionally, 4-axis digital image stabilization may be employed during video recording to help stabilize footage, especially while filming handheld.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">UHD and DCI 4K Video Recording</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">Beyond stills, the X-T4 has a diverse range of video capabilities, including internal DCI/UHD 4K recording at up to 60 fps and Full HD recording at up to 240 fps for super slow-motion playback. The X-Processor 4's speed improves overall video performance by enabling rapid read rates while recording video and reducing rolling shutter distortion when capturing moving subjects. A micro-HDMI connector also allows for 10-bit 4:2:2 recording to an external recorder. The X-T4 has the F-Log gamma setting, which produces a flat image for use in advanced color grading applications during editing, in addition to the supporting 10-bit color depth. This increases the possible dynamic range in tough circumstances, and picture modifications to highlight tone, shadow tone, color, and sharpness may also be done.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Body Design</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The FUJIFILM X-T4 Mirrorless Digital Camera's bright, high-resolution 3.69m-dot OLED electronic viewfinder features a 0.75x magnification and the EVF's refresh rate can be increased to 100 fps to eliminate latency for smoother panning and tracking motions. The various-angle 3.0\" 1.62m-dot LCD boasts a touchscreen interface for straightforward control and playback, and the articulating design greatly improves operating from high and low shooting angles. This variable-angle design also allows you to shut the screen against the camera body, hiding it from view for distraction-free shooting. The top plate features several locking dials and levers for quick, simple management of exposure settings, including dedicated shutter speed, ISO, and exposure compensation dials that allow direct setting modification even when the camera is turned off. This exposure compensation dial also features a C position for a +/- 5 EV range when used in conjunction with the command dials. Front and rear command dials provide a push function for easy operation and setting choices. The rear joystick may be used for easy AF point selection and switching, menu navigation, and image playback. The mechanical shutter has been rebuilt and is rated for 300,000 actuation.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Movie Mode</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">Every component of the X-T4 has been engineered to accommodate the hybrid photographer, including a separate STILL/MOVIE lever that allows for smooth transitions between photography and videography. To allow hassle-free movie creation, a video-specific menu and the addition of a video-only Quick Menu (Q Menu) are added to this feature.</p><h2 style=\"\"><span style=\"color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, sans-serif;\">Buy </span>FUJIFILM X-T4 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Body Only) from the best Camera Shop in BD</h2><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In Bangladesh, you can get an original <a href=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/fujifilm-x-t4-mirrorless-digital-camera\" target=\"\">FUJIFILM X-T4 Mirrorless Digital Camera</a> From Star Tech.

This camera, which tops the X System, combines the intuitiveness, design, and image quality that FUJIFILM is recognized for with a new, quick approach to video and continuous shooting applications.</p><h3>X-Trans 5 Stacked BSI Sensor</h3><p>The X-H2S is the first X Series camera to utilize a stacked sensor, with an APS-C-format 26.1MP X-Trans 5 stacked BSI sensor that enhances readout rates and low-light performance over prior generations. First, as an X-Trans sensor, it employs a unique color filter array that reduces moiré and contributes to more natural color rendering; second, the BSI design reduces noise and improves tonality and clarity; and, finally, the stacked design greatly reduces rolling shutter and other motion distortion to better suit high-speed video and photo photo applications.</p><h3>X-Processor 5</h3><p>In addition to the newly built sensor, the X-Processor 5 features 64-bit processing of <strong>X-H2S</strong> to provide 3x quicker rates for both video and picture activities than the X-T4. On the video side, this permits recording at up to 6.2K with high bitrates, such as ProRes 422 HQ, or at high speeds, such as 240 fps Full HD recording. On the stills side, quicker processing implies faster shooting to accommodate capturing moving subjects. Shooting at up to 40 frames per second is possible when using an electronic shutter, with a buffer of 140 consecutive uncompressed raw frames. Shooting speeds of up to 15 frames per second are feasible with the mechanical shutter, as is the capacity to shoot up to 1000 raw shots in a single burst.</p><h3>4K 120p and 6.2K 30p Internal Recording</h3><p>The X-H2S features a well-rounded recording mechanism that positions this camera solidly in the 'hybrid' category and works equally well for video as it does for photo. Internal 4:2:2 10-bit recording in DCI/UHD 4K at up to 120p and Full HD at up to 240p, as well as an open-gate 3:2 6.2K option appropriate for anamorphic applications, is possible. H.265 and three ProRes tiers are also supported, including the high bandwidth 422 HQ, the normal 422, and the more compressed 422 LT. At all frame rates and resolutions, continuous recording lengths of up to 90 minutes are feasible.</p><h3>External Raw Recording</h3><p>When linked X-H2S with a suitable external recorder, raw video recording via the full-size HDMI connector is available. Both ProRes RAW and Blackmagic RAW recording are supported, as well as working with F-Log or F-Log 2 profiles and working at resolutions up to the open-gate 6.2K.</p><h3>Hybrid AF with Deep Learning AI</h3><p>Autofocus performance is substantially quicker and more intelligent as a result of the increased processing. This hybrid focusing technology employs 425 phase-detection points and is now sensitive down to -7 EV, allowing it to function in really low-light circumstances. Furthermore, an AI adaptable algorithm powered by deep learning implies that this focusing system is better adapted to automatically recognize and track a range of subject categories. facial and Eye Detection capabilities of the <strong>X-H2S</strong> have been enhanced in comparison to prior focusing systems for higher accuracy and to account for distinctive characteristics such as spectacles, facial coverings, and hairlines. In addition, the list of authorized topic types has been enlarged to include automobiles, planes, trains, motorcycles, birds, horses, dogs, cats, and other animals.</p><h3>In-Body Image Stabilization</h3><p>The X-H2S camera's built-in 5-axis sensor-shift image stabilization reduces the appearance of camera shake by up to 7 stops. This technology works with most X Series lenses, including non-stabilized ones, and is useful for shooting at slower shutter speeds or in low-light situations. Additionally, digital image stabilization can be employed during video recording to help stabilize footage, particularly while shooting handheld.</p><h3>Practical and Durable Design</h3><p>Bright, clear, and detailed eye-level viewing is made possible by the large OLED electronic viewfinder's 0.8x magnification and sharp 5.76m-dot resolution.  The X-H2S camera of rear 3.0\"LCD is equipped with the highest 1.62 mdot resolution for intuitive control, and also has a touchscreen interface. Moreover, it features a multidirectional design that allows the display to be tilted on either side, raised or downwards and closed with an integrated screen facing the body for protection. An easy way to quickly review the shooting settings is by using a 1.28\" black and white LCD panel on the top plate.</p><h3>Flexible Connectivity</h3><p>Full-size HDMI Type A connector for video output to a display or recorder outside the house. The <strong>X-H2S</strong> camera has Type-C USB 3.2 Gen 2 port allows data transfer, tethering, and in-camera battery charging. For more control over audio recording, there are external microphone and 3.5mm headphone ports available. Flash sync via the PC sync port. For use with wired remote controllers, use the 2.5mm remote port. It is possible to share photos wirelessly to a mobile device or utilize the device to control the camera remotely thanks to integrated Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity.</p><h3>Film Simulation Modes</h3><p>Film Simulation modes of X-H2S allow you to recreate the look and feel of numerous FUJIFILM film types, including Provia, Velvia, Astia, Classic Chrome, Classic Neg., Nostalgic Neg., Pro Neg., and Pro Neg. Hello, Professional Negative Standard, Eterna, Eterna Bleach Bypass, Acros, Monochrome, and Sepia. Additionally, the Grain Effect and Color Chrome effects can be tweaked to fine-tune the look of the imagery.</p><h2>Buy FUJIFILM X-H2S Mirrorless Camera(Only Body) from the best Camera Shop in BD</h2><p>In Bangladesh, you can get an original <strong>FUJIFILM X-H2S Mirrorless Camera(Only Body)</strong> From Star Tech.

Because it is an X-Trans sensor, it also uses a randomized pixel array, which eliminates the need for an optical low-pass filter and results in very crisp and high-quality images. The X-Trans design more closely resembles the organic nature of film than traditional pixel patterns, which helps to reduce moiré and aliasing and provide subtle hues and tonal shifts. An extended phase-detection autofocus system with 425 customizable points that covers almost the whole sensor surface is also a feature of the sensor's design. </p><h3>Hybrid Multi Viewfinder</h3><p>A crisp, realistic picture of the scene is provided by the optical viewfinder, making subject tracking and composition simpler. The improved design includes an Electronic Rangefinder feature that functions similarly to a mechanical rangefinder while also superimposing data from the electronic viewfinder over the optical viewfinder to provide manual focus adjustment that is more comparable. The electronic viewfinder of FUJIFILM X-Pro3 has a rapid playback speed of 100 frames per second (fps) and a high 3.69 million dot resolution to minimize latency and provide better tracking and panning motions. In addition to having a display that can be customized to change the type and quantity of information displayed in the viewfinder, the EVF allows you to evaluate exposure settings before shooting. </p><h3>UHD and DCI 4K Video Recording</h3><p>The <strong>X-Pro3</strong> is more than just a stills camera; it has an alluring variety of video features, such as internal DCI/UHD 4K recording at up to 30 frames per second. The speed of the X-Processor 4 significantly improves overall video performance by allowing high read rates in 4K footage and assisting in the reduction of rolling shutter distortion while capturing moving objects. A 2.5mm external microphone port is also included on the camera for more sophisticated audio options.</p><h3>Film Simulation and Grain Effect Modes</h3><p>Utilizing FUJIFILM's extensive background in conventional film-based photography, the X-Pro3 has many Film Simulation modes. These modes imitate the appearance and feel of some of FUJIFILM's classic film types: Classic Chrome, which is intended to produce muted tones and a deep color reproduction, akin to that of an antiquated slide film; Acros, which offers smooth tones, deep blacks, and fine detail; and Eterna, which replicates the look of cinematic film with subdued colors and richer shadow tones. There are several other effects that may be used for both color and monochrome photography. A Grain Effect setting is also available to mimic the appearance of vintage film images with an organic grainy appearance, which is particularly visible when printing, in addition to replicating specific film types.</p><h2>Buy FUJIFILM X-Pro3 Mirrorless Camera (Body Only) from the best Camera Shop in BD</h2><p>In Bangladesh, you can get an original <strong>FUJIFILM X-Pro3 Mirrorless Camera (Body Only)</strong> From Star Tech.

This high-performing camera, which sits atop the X-System lineup, inherits many of the GFX system's advances in digital capture technology to provide image quality, detail, and color rendition never before seen in a crop-sensor camera, while retaining the compact form factor and sleek design that have earned the X-System a loyal following worldwide.</p><img src=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/image/catalog/camera/mirriorless/fujifilm/x-h2/x-h2-001.jpg\" alt=\"FUJIFILM X-H2 Mirrorless Camera With 16-80mm Lens\" width=\"920\" height=\"450\"><h3>X-Trans 5 BSI Sensor</h3><p>The FUJIFILM X-H2 is ideal for architecture, travel, and landscape photographers, and it features a backside-illuminated, APS-C-format 40MP X-Trans 5 HR sensor, which increases resolution and improves low-light performance over prior generations. First, as an X-Trans sensor, it employs a unique color filter array that reduces moiré and contributes to more natural color rendering; second, the BSI design reduces noise and improves tonality and clarity; and, finally, the design greatly reduces rolling shutter and other motion distortion to better suit high-speed video and photo applications. </p><h3>X-Processor 5</h3><p>The newly built sensor of FUJIFILM X-H2, the X-Processor 5 features 64-bit processing to provide 3x quicker rates for both video and picture activities than the X-T4. This permits video recording at bit rates of up to 720 mb/s. On the stills side, quicker processing implies faster shooting to accommodate capturing moving subjects. Shooting at up to 20 frames per second is possible when using an electronic shutter, with a buffer of 202 consecutive uncompressed raw frames. Shooting speeds of up to 15 frames per second are feasible with the mechanical shutter, as is the capacity to shoot up to 1000 raw shots in a single burst.</p><h3>External Raw Recording</h3><p>When linked FUJIFILM <strong>X-H2</strong> with a suitable external recorder, 12-bit raw video recording is allowed via the full-size HDMI connector. Both ProRes RAW and Blackmagic RAW recording are supported, as well as F-Log or F-Log 2 profiles and resolutions up to open-gate 8K.</p><h3>Pixel Shift Multishot</h3><p>With the aid of the Pixel Shift Combiner software, Pixel Shift Multishot makes numerous exposures in quick succession, each one accurately moving the image sensor by half a pixel, catching the subject on a different region of the image sensor each time and providing a single 160-Megapixel image by the FUJIFILM X-H2.</p><h3>In-Body Image Stabilization</h3><p>The FUJIFILM <strong>X-H2</strong> camera has built-in 5-axis sensor-shift image stabilization which reduces the appearance of camera shaking by up to 7 stops. This technology works with most X Series lenses, including non-stabilized ones, and is useful for shooting at slower shutter speeds or in low-light situations. Additionally, digital image stabilization can be employed during video recording to help stabilize footage, particularly while shooting handheld.</p><h3>Hybrid AF with Deep Learning AI</h3><p>Autofocus performance is substantially quicker and more intelligent as a result of the increased processing. This hybrid focusing technology of FUJIFILM X-H2 employs 425 phase-detection points and is now sensitive down to -7 EV, allowing it to function in really low-light circumstances. Furthermore, an AI adaptable algorithm powered by deep learning implies that this focusing system is better adapted to automatically recognize and track a range of subject categories.</p><img src=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/image/catalog/camera/mirriorless/fujifilm/x-h2/x-h2-002.jpg\" alt=\"FUJIFILM X-H2 Mirrorless Camera With 16-80mm Lens\" width=\"920\" height=\"450\"><h3>Practical and Durable Design</h3><p>For bright, clear, and detailed eye-level viewing with FUJIFILM X-H2, the large OLED electronic viewfinder has a sharp 5.76m-dot resolution and a 0.8x magnification. The rear 3.0\" LCD display boasts a high 1.62m-dot resolution and a touchscreen interface for easy control. Furthermore, the screen's vari-angle construction allows it to be flipped out to the side, angled up or down, and closed with the screen against the body for protection. The 1.28\" monochrome LCD screen on the top plate provides a quick way to examine shooting settings. For file-saving versatility, there are two memory card slots: one CFexpress Type B slot and one SD UHS-II slot. The CFexpress Type B slot should be prioritized for higher bitrate video recording and quick continuous shooting, while the SD slot can be used for backups or less time-critical shooting.</p><h3>Flexible Connectivity</h3><p>Full-size HDMI Type A output port for connecting to an external recorder or monitor. Tethering, data transfer, and in-camera battery charging are all supported by the USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C connection. For more control over audio recording, there are 3.5mm headphone and external microphone connectors of <strong>FUJIFILM X-H2</strong>. PC sync port for flash synchronization. For use with wired remote controllers, a 2.5mm remote port is included. The camera's integrated Bluetooth and Wi-Fi networking enables wireless image sharing to a mobile device as well as remote control via the device.</p><h3>FUJIFILM XF 16-80mm f/4 R OIS WR Lens</h3><p>The FUJIFILM <strong>XF 16-80mm</strong> f/4 R OIS WR is a flexible 24-120mm-equivalent zoom lens of FUJIFILM X-H2 with a continuous f/4 maximum aperture that is well-suited for a wide range of shooting settings. This adaptable architecture is complemented with an innovative optical arrangement that contains three aspherical elements and one ED aspherical element to assist decrease aberrations and deliver outstanding sharpness and clarity. When working in bright light, a Super EBC coating increases contrast and color neutrality by decreasing flare and ghosting. A rapid and silent autofocus mechanism, as well as a six-stop image stabilization technology that eliminates the impression of camera shake, are very useful in a range of circumstances. </p><h2>Buy FUJIFILM X-H2 Mirrorless Camera With 16-80mm Lens from Star Tech</h2><p>In Bangladesh, you can get an original <strong>FUJIFILM X-H2 Mirrorless Camera With 16-80mm Lens</strong> From Star Tech.

While the camera's body design harkens back to the filmic, steel-feel functionalism of vintage SLRs, its insides are packed with the latest Z-series features and capabilities, transforming the Zf's iconic silhouette into a modern and tactile shooter that uses advanced technology to deliver timeless imagery. </p><img src=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/image/catalog/camera/mirriorless/nikon/nikon-zf/nikon-zf-001.webp\" alt=\"Nikon Zf 24.5MP Mirrorless Camera(Only Body)\" width=\"920\" height=\"450\"><h3>Immersive and Intuitive Design</h3><p>The machined edges, knurled dials, and marbled texture of the Zf are intended to completely immerse the user in the sensory sensation of using a beautiful machine. The dials for shutter speed, ISO, and exposure adjustment are precision-carved metal with etched markings for superior manual control. The mechanical shutter opens with a loud, commanding click. A special black-and-white mode with two monochromatic recipes is also accessible at the touch of a button. This user-friendly, haptic-friendly design isn't limited to the camera's retro-styled controls.</p><h3>24.5MP FX-Format BSI CMOS Sensor</h3><p>A 24.5MP BSI CMOS sensor of <strong>Nikon Zf</strong> is employed for all-around photography, delivering exceptional low-light image quality and quick readout times to enable continuous shooting, movies, and time-lapse recording. The sensor's back-illuminated architecture also provides visibly clear high-sensitivity output for decreased noise while operating at high ISO settings. The Zf also has a high-resolution photo mode that combines numerous exposures into a single 96MP file. </p><h3>UHD 4K Recording and Versatile Video Control</h3><p>The new shutter-priority exposure mode allows you to record with a set shutter speed while making smooth ISO and aperture changes to preserve consistent brightness in your photo. The <strong>Nikon Zf</strong>, like the camera's high-end picture features, offers a selection of frame rates and resolutions for all of your video demands. Oversampled from 6K, UHD 4K video recording with complete pixel readout up to 30p is available, and complete HD 1080p video recording with full pixel readout up to 120p for slow motion playback is also enabled. Internal 10-bit H.265 recording to a memory card for up to 125 minutes in SDR/HLG/N-log tone modes.</p><h3>Fast and Intelligent AF</h3><p>Eye-Detection AF for photo and video captures the eyes of people, dogs, and birds even when they are very small in the frame. The function Nikon Zf is now available for manual focus lenses for the first time, instantly enlarging the area surrounding the eyes so you can immediately check sharp focus.</p><img src=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/image/catalog/camera/mirriorless/nikon/nikon-zf/nikon-zf-002.webp\" alt=\"Nikon Zf 24.5MP Mirrorless Camera(Only Body)\" width=\"920\" height=\"450\"><h3>Vibration Reduction</h3><p>Sensor-shifting on five axes within the body When used with Z-mount lenses, Vibration Reduction compensates for up to 8 stops of camera motion, allowing you to drop shutter speed an incredible 8.0 stops slower than would otherwise be feasible without generating picture blur. Additionally, when utilizing the optional FTZ Adapter, this system works with modified F-mount lenses where 3-axis stabilization is employed.</p><h2>Buy Nikon Zf 24.5MP Mirrorless Camera(Only Body) from Star Tech</h2><p>In Bangladesh, you can get an original <strong>Nikon Zf 24.5MP Mirrorless Camera(Only Body)</strong> From Star Tech.

The usage of a global shutter outperforms rolling shutter technology, which has been employed for decades. A global shutter allows for a nearly immediate and simultaneous reading of all 24.6MP, avoiding skew and other distortions that plagued rolling shutters. It also outperforms mechanical shutter technology in every manner, rendering the physical shutter obsolete with the Alpha a9 III.</p><h3>Pre-Capture and Speed Boost</h3><p>The Alpha a9 III may be set to start recording photos to the buffer while the shutter button is half pushed. Users can change this anywhere from 0.05 to 1.0 second. When you push the shutter, these photographs will be recorded on the memory card. Not every shoot necessitates the <strong>Alpha a9 III</strong> has amazing top speed of 120 fps. With Speed Boost and the C5 button, which is conveniently located near the grip on the front of the camera, users may rapidly convert their camera's continuous shooting frame rate to a quicker one to ensure their next photo is perfect. Photographers will be able to choose frame rates of up to 120 fps.</p><h3>Enhanced Functionality and Usability</h3><p>A voice memo function offers crisper recordings with a microphone placed near to the user. These notes may be transmitted via FTP and converted to text with Sony's Transfer &amp; Tagging tool. IPTC metadata may be automatically applied to photos, and up to 20 presets can be stored. Image bursts may now be shown as a group during playback, making it easier to traverse through a shoot, particularly when using the Alpha a9 III's fastest continuous shooting rates. During filming, the built-in Wi-Fi and Ethernet may be utilized to transport data quickly across the network. </p><h2>Buy Sony Alpha A9 III Full Frame Mirrorless Camera (Only Body) from Star Tech</h2><p>In Bangladesh, you can get the original <strong>Sony Alpha A9 III Full Frame Mirrorless Camera (Only Body)</strong> From Star Tech.

DCI 4K30 and Full HD 1080p120 recordings are also supported, and video files may be stored in MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 or HEVC/H.265 compression, as well as 4K. The quad-CPU X-Processor 4's speed greatly improves overall video performance by enabling quick read rates of 17 ms while recording 4K60 footage, which helps to decrease rolling shutter distortion when capturing moving objects. The X-T3 has the F-Log gamma setting, which produces a flat image for use in advanced color grading applications during editing, in addition to the supporting 10-bit color depth. This increases the possible dynamic range in tough circumstances, and picture modifications to highlight tone, shadow tone, color, and sharpness may also be done. Working in F-Log now includes an improved noise reduction algorithm as well as 4K inter-frame noise reduction, and the minimum sensitivity has been reduced to ISO 640 to accommodate working in a wider range of scene types.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Body Design</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">A 3.69m-dot OLED electronic viewfinder provides a high 0.75x magnification, rapid 100 fps refresh rate, broad viewing angle, and lockable diopter adjustment. The viewfinder is blackout-free while shooting at up to 30 frames per second, and a special Sports Finder Mode can also be used, which highlights a 16.6MP crop area of the sensor to allow you to see outside of the image frame. A rear 3.0\" 1.04m-dot LCD touchscreen is offered in addition to the EVF for easy live view shooting, playback and review, settings modification, and menu navigation. The screen also includes a three-way tilting design to accommodate working from high and low angles while filming horizontally or vertically. Dual SD card slots provide a more versatile and dependable way of storing imagery, and both card slots are UHS-II compliant for rapid transfer speeds. The top plate features several locking dials and levers for quick, simple exposure control, including a shutter speed dial for direct shutter speed change. The shutter speed dial includes an ISO dial for validating the sensitivity setting without turning on the camera, and the exposure compensation dial allows you to pick +/- 3 EV in 1/3 increments, with a command dial position expanding the range to +/- 5 EV for even more flexibility.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Modes for Film Simulation and Grain Effect</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The X-T3 incorporates multiple Film Simulation modes, leveraging Fujifilm's extensive experience with conventional film-based photography. These modes are designed to replicate the look and feel of some of Fujifilm's classic film types, such as Eterna, which mimics the look of cinematic film with understated colors and richer shadow tones; Acros, which offers smooth tones, deep blacks, and fine detail; and Classic Chrome, which is designed to diver muted tones and deep color reproduction, similar to that of dated slide film. Other effects are available for both monochrome and color photography. A Grain Effect setting, in addition to mimicking specific film types, is available to imitate the look of antique film images with an organic grainy appearance, which is notably visible when printing.</p><h2 style=\"\">Buy&nbsp;FUJIFILM X-T3 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Body Only) from the best Camera Shop in BD</h2><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In Bangladesh, you can get an original <a href=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/fujifilm-x-t3-mirrorless-digital-camera\" target=\"\">FUJIFILM X-T3 Mirrorless Digital Camera</a> From Star Tech.

With a short 16mm flange distance and a large diameter design, the Z Mount is a new feature of this high-resolution FX-format camera that enables Nikon to produce more advanced optics and compact cameras with greater power. With a native sensitivity range of ISO 64–25600 and a 45.7MP BSI CMOS sensor and an EXPEED 6 Image Processing Engine, the Z7 is one of the first models in the series and offers outstanding image quality and speed.</p><h3>45.7MP FX-Format BSI CMOS Sensor and EXPEED 6 Processor</h3><p>A 45.7MP BSI CMOS sensor is used in the Nikon Z7 for high-resolution shooting, impressive low-light quality, and fast readout speeds to benefit continuous shooting, movies, and time-lapse recording. When operating at high ISO values, up to a native ISO 25600, the back-illuminated sensor's architecture allows for substantially cleaner high-sensitivity output for reduced noise, as well as vibrant and smooth clarity at sensitivities as low as ISO 64. To maximize the sensor's clarity and resolution, the traditional optical low-pass filter was also removed from the design. The EXPEED 6 image processor, which gives the camera system a lot of speed and can shoot continuously at 9 frames per second in raw, benefits the sensor.</p><h3>4K UHD Video Recording and 8K Time-Lapse</h3><p>The Nikon Z7 is a more-than-capable multimedia camera, utilizing the sensor and processing characteristics for more than simply still pictures. UHD 4K (3840 x 2160) video recording is possible in 30p, 25p, or 24p frame rates using either the full-frame area or a DX crop region. Full HD 1080p video recording at up to 120p for slow motion playback is also available, and video files can be stored on internal memory cards or as an uncompressed file to an optional external recorder via HDMI out.</p><h3>493-Point Phase-Detect AF System</h3><p>The Nikon Z7 comes with an array of 493 phase-detect autofocus points located on the sensor cover 90% of the image area both vertically and horizontally. This allows fast and accurate focusing for both stills and video, and with a wide coverage area, subject tracking will work out to the frame's edges. For video, hybrid AF is available, which automatically switches between phase- and contrast-detect systems to provide smooth focus throughout shooting. Furthermore, the latest NIKKOR Z lenses are intended for silent operation.</p><h3>Large 3.2\" 2.1m-dot LCD screen and 3.6M-Dot Quad VGA Viewfinder</h3><p>For bright, crisp, and vivid image playback and live view filming, a 3.2\" 2.1m-dot LCD screen is provided. The screen is tilted to benefit from working from both high and low angles, and it is also a touchscreen for more intuitive operation, navigation, and setting control. The&nbsp;Nikon Z7 Mirrorless Digital Camera also has a&nbsp;3.6m-dot electronic finder for comfortable eye-level viewing. It boasts a high magnification of 0.80x and employs NIKKOR optics to ensure a sharp, clear image. The finder also includes a Fluorine coating for easier cleaning.</p><h3>Built-in SnapBridge connectivity</h3><p>Nikon Z7 Full Frame Mirrorless Digital Camera comes with built-in SnapBridge connectivity for easy transfer of low-resolution imagery and remote shooting capabilities. BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) and Wi-Fi enable the connection between the camera and a smart device; additionally, the mobile device can remotely trigger the shutter and display a live view image from the camera to enable working from a distance.</p><h2 style=\"\">Buy Nikon Z7 Mirrorless Digital Camera&nbsp;from the best Camera Shop in BD</h2><p style=\"\">In Bangladesh, you can get an original&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/nikon-z7-mirrorless-digital-camera\" target=\"\">Nikon Z7 Mirrorless Digital Camera</a>&nbsp;From Star Tech.
