Engineered to work seamlessly with RF lenses, the EOS RP also maintains complete compatibility with EF and EF-S lenses by using one of three optional Mount Adapters. When using EF-S lenses, the EOS RP even crops automatically to reflect the APS-C sized sensor the lenses are designed for. The EOS RP camera features a Canon-developed and produced 35mm full-frame CMOS sensor with approx. 26.2 effective megapixels. It employs the DIGIC 8 Image Processor to enhance the speed of operations across the board. This means fast, efficient performance and phenomenal image quality for big prints. The EOS RP camera's highly responsive Dual Pixel CMOS AF system features 4,779 manually selectable AF points** and can deliver sharp focus within approximately 0.05 seconds***. This means fast action can be captured and focus can be maintained with speed, accuracy and ease. Amazing for nighttime photography or in very low light, the EOS RP camera's brilliant AF can operate in light as dim as a light rating of EV -5^ where other AF systems may fail or search. Phenomenal AF is achieved even when using lenses with high F numbers. This ultra-sensitive AF works in concert with the EOS RP's EVF to clearly capture subjects even when there's limited light. Among the EOS RP camera's manual focus aids, Focus Peaking helps establish the focus area quickly and clearly. With manual focus peaking, the outline of the area in focus is indicated by a colored line. Focus Peaking is usable in conjunction with the EOS RP's Focus Guide feature, and can be customized with peaking color and detection level specifications that fit the project at hand. The EOS RP camera features a high-precision 0.39-inch OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode) EVF with approx. 2.36 million dots and a 22mm eyepoint. The electronic viewfinder (EVF) has been created to provide a bright, sharp and colorful 100% view of the subject at hand. Equipped with an aspherical lens, the EVF shows a crisp and vivid image with minimal distortion, even when the eye moves off the center of the visual field. The EOS RP EVF has a bright, 22mm-high eyepoint design that creates a generous 30mm space between your nose and the rear of the viewfinder. This makes it easy to compose and view images in the viewfinder with or without glasses. The EVF's 0.39-inch OLED based display features approximately 2.36 million dots for an incredibly sharp and detailed image that makes it easy to check focus and view the extensive image data that's displayed. The EOS RP camera features a 3.0-inch, 1.04 Megapixel Clear View LCD II Vari-angle Touchscreen LCD. Brightness is adjustable in seven levels. Its extensive flexibility makes it easy to compose and shoot from virtually any angle, making selfies simple and enabling the LCD to fold away when not in use. The brightness of the EVF and the LCD monitor can even be adjusted individually - a first for an EOS camera. Touchscreen features include settings, review and even AF point selection.<br></p>","specifications":[{"heading":"Image Sensor","values":[{"key":"Sensor Type","value":"CMOS sensor (compatible with Dual Pixel CMOS AF)"},{"key":"Effective pixels","value":"Approx. 30.3 megapixels"},{"key":"Aspect Ratio","value":"3:2 (Horizontal:Vertical)"}]},{"heading":"Focus","values":[{"key":"Focus Mode","value":"One-Shot AF"},{"key":"AF Point","value":"Max. 5,655"}]},{"heading":"Exposure Control","values":[{"key":"Metering Modes","value":"Evaluative metering (AF point-linked)"},{"key":"ISO Sensitivity","value":"Normal ISO 100 - 40000 (in 1/3-stop or whole-stop increments)"}]},{"heading":"Shutter","values":[{"key":"Shutter Speed","value":"1/8000 to 30 sec., bulb (total range of all shooting modes)"}]},{"heading":"LCD Monitor","values":[{"key":"Type","value":"TFT color, liquid-crystal monitor"},{"key":"Viewing Angle","value":"Approx. 100% vertically/horizontally"}]},{"heading":"Shooting","values":[{"key":"Color Space","value":"Selectable between sRGB and Adobe RGB"}]},{"heading":"File Type","values":[{"key":"Image Type","value":"EXIF 2.3 (DCF2.0)"},{"key":"Image Size","value":"3:2 Aspect Ratio"},{"key":"Movie Type","value":"MP4"},{"key":"Movie Size","value":"4K (UHD)"}]},{"heading":"Storage","values":[{"key":"Storage Type","value":"SD/SDHC/SDXC memory cards"}]},{"heading":"Flash","values":[{"key":"Built-in Flash","value":"No"},{"key":"External Flash Compatibility","value":"The camera can set the following with EX series Speedlites:"}]},{"heading":"Power Source","values":[{"key":"Battery","value":"Battery Pack LP-E6N (or LP-E6) x 1"}]},{"heading":"Physical Specification","values":[{"key":"Dimensions (W x H x D)","value":"Approx. 5.35 x 3.87 x 3.32 in. / 135.8 x 98.3 x 84.4mm"},{"key":"Weight (Body Only)","value":"Approx. 1.46 lbs. / 660g (including battery, SD memory card; without body cap)"}]},{"heading":"Other Features","values":[{"key":"Features","value":"CMOS sensor (compatible with Dual Pixel CMOS AF)"}]},{"heading":"Lens","values":[{"key":"Maximum Aperture","value":"f/4"}]},{"heading":"Warranty Information","values":[{"key":"Warranty","value":"03 Years Service Warranty (No parts warranty)"}]}],"latest_price":{"heading":"What is the price of Canon EOS R DSLR Camera Body in Bangladesh?","paragraph":"The latest price of Canon EOS R DSLR Camera Body in Bangladesh is 156,500৳.

It features a newly developed 45MP CMOS sensor, 8K raw video recording, 12 fps continuous shooting with a mechanical shutter, and is the first EOS camera to feature 5-axis sensor-shift image stabilization. In addition to the image assets, the R5, despite its redesigned design, feels familiar to EOS 5-series customers. A very high-resolution 0.5\" 5.76m-dot electronic viewfinder provides a realistic 120 fps refresh rate, while the 3.2\" rear touchscreen LCD panel has a vari-angle design to satisfy vlogging demands and benefit working from high and low angles. A top status LCD allows for an easy workflow, and the camera includes two memory card slots—one CFexpress Type B and one SD UHS-II—as well as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi wireless connection.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/image/catalog/camera/dslr-camera/canon/eos-r5/eos-r5-003.jpg\" alt=\"Canon EOS R5 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Only Body)\" width=\"920\" height=\"450\"><h3>IBIS High Resolution 400MP Files</h3>\n<p>The IBIS High Resolution shot option on the EOS R5 with firmware 1.8.1 or later may produce 400 megapixel (approx.) files in-camera without the need for additional software. This capability is useful in instances when a high-resolution file with fine detail is required. Art replication and architectural signs are two examples.</p>\n<h3>45MP Full-Frame Sensor and DIGIC X Processor</h3>\n<p>The EOS R5 is built on a newly designed 45MP full-frame CMOS sensor and delivers both high-resolution stills and video output, with the fine-tuned DIGIC X image processor providing a wealth of speed. The ISO 100-51200 sensitivity range, which can be raised to ISO 102400, is perfect for working in a variety of lighting circumstances, while rapid continuous shooting at up to 12 frames per second with a mechanical shutter or quiet 20 frames per second with an electronic shutter is great for dealing with moving subjects.</p>\n<h3>8K30 Raw and 4K120 Video Recording</h3>\n<p>The 45MP full-frame sensor of EOS R5 allows for astonishingly high-resolution DCI 8K 30 fps raw video recording internally, as well as 4K recording up to 120 fps in 4:2:2 10-bit with Canon Log. HDR-PQ recording is also supported, as well as in-camera HDR creation and external recording via the HDMI connector, which provides a crisp 4K output at up to 60 frames per second. There are choices for both All-I and IPB compression, as well as Dual Pixel CMOS AF when shooting at up to 8K raw.</p>\n<h3>HDMI 8K Raw Output to Atomos Ninja V+</h3>\n<p>Firmware update 1.4.0 adds the ability to output 8K30, 10-bit footage to the Atomos Ninja V+ recorder via an optional HDMI connection for ProRes raw recording. (Please keep in mind that the recorder may grow heated.)</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/image/catalog/camera/dslr-camera/canon/eos-r5/eos-r5-002.jpg\" alt=\"Canon EOS R5 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Only Body)\" width=\"920\" height=\"450\"><h3>Body Design and Wireless Connectivity</h3>\n<p>The EOS R5 has five-axis sensor-shift image stabilization, a first for EOS cameras, that adjusts for up to an amazing eight stops of camera motion for genuinely effective compensation of camera shake for handheld photography with slower shutter speeds. This stabilization technology is also compatible with lens-based optical image stabilization for both original RF and modified EF lenses.</p>\n<h3>Dual Pixel CMOS AF II</h3>\n<p>The upgraded Dual Pixel CMOS AF II has 1053 customizable focusing points that cover around 100% of the picture frame for wide and even coverage. This focusing technology of EOS R5 provides smooth and rapid focusing performance in the same way as a camcorder does. A Movie Servo AF option for recording video provides smooth and natural focusing when switching between objects or distances inside the picture, as well as the flexibility to select tracking sensitivity, AF speed, and Face Tracking priority. Rack focus is achieved with the Touch AF technology simply by touching parts within the scene on the touchscreen to adjust focus in an easy manner. The high-resolution 5.67m-dot 0.5\"</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/image/catalog/camera/dslr-camera/canon/eos-r5/eos-r5-001.jpg\" alt=\"Canon EOS R5 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Only Body)\" width=\"920\" height=\"450\"><h3>Body Design and Wireless Connectivity</h3>\nThe high-resolution 5.67m-dot 0.5\" electronic viewfinder is bright and crisp for eye-level viewing, and the rapid 120 fps refresh rate enables natural motion depiction for a more realistic viewfinder experience. The rear 3.2\" 2.1m-dot LCD touchscreen has a vari-angle design that advantages both front-facing filming, such as for vlogging, and working from high and low shooting angles. To rapidly examine camera and shooting settings, utilize the top status LCD. For versatile storage, CFexpress Type B and SD UHS-II memory card ports are included; the CFexpress slot is perfect for 8K video and high-speed, high-resolution burst shooting, while the SD card slot preserves a familiar form factor for wide compatibility.<p></p>\n<h2>Buy Canon EOS R5 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Only Body) from Star Tech</h2>\n<p>In Bangladesh, you can get the original Canon EOS R5 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Only Body) From Star Tech.
