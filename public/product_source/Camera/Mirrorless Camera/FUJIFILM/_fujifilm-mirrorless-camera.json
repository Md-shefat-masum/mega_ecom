In comparison to traditional pixel patterns, the X-Trans design more closely resembles the organic nature of film to provide subtle colors and tonal transitions while also eliminating moiré and aliasing.</p><h3>X-Processor 4</h3><p>This AF technology of <strong>FUJIFILM X-E4</strong> provides faster, more accurate focusing in a wide range of illumination settings down to -7 EV. An updated X-Processor 4 with a quad-core CPU complements the imaging and focusing capabilities, delivering faster, more responsive performance throughout the camera system, including a full-resolution 8 fps shooting rate with the mechanical shutter, a 20 fps rate with an electronic shutter, or a 30 fps rate with an electronic shutter and a 1.25x crop.</p><h3>UHD and DCI 4K Video Recording</h3><p>Beyond stills, the X-E4 has a diverse range of video capabilities, including internal DCI/UHD 4K recording at up to 30 fps and Full HD recording at up to 240 fps for super slow-motion playback. The X-Processor 4's speed improves overall video performance by enabling rapid read rates while recording video and reducing rolling shutter distortion when capturing moving subjects. A micro-HDMI connector also allows for 10-bit 4:2:2 recording to an external recorder.</p><h3>Body Design</h3><p>The 0.62x magnification of the bright, high-resolution 2.36m-dot OLED electronic viewfinder ensures clear and comfortable eye-level viewing. The touchscreen design of the tilting 3.0\" 1.62m-dot LCD of <strong>FUJIFILM X-E4</strong> allows for straightforward operation and playback, and the 180° upward tilting design greatly favors working from high and front-facing shooting angles. The top plate features a number of physical controls for quick, simple exposure tuning, including separate shutter speed and exposure compensation knobs that allow direct modification even when the camera is turned off. This exposure compensation dial also features a C position for a +/- 5 EV range when used in conjunction with the command dials. The rear joystick may be used for easy AF point selection and switching, menu navigation, and image playback.</p><h3>XF 27mm f/2.8 R WR Lens</h3><p>The very small pancake prime XF 27mm f/2.8 R WR lens of FUJIFILM X-E4 is included with the camera body. This 41mm-equivalent lens has been upgraded with a weather-sealed construction and a manual aperture ring for easy exposure control adjustment. In terms of optics, one aspherical element is used to decrease distortion and spherical aberrations, while a Super EBC coating is used to suppress flare and ghosting. A high-torque DC coreless motor is also employed to achieve rapid, precise, and near-silent focusing capability, which benefits both picture and video applications.</p><h2>Buy FUJIFILM X-E4 Mirrorless Camera with 27mm Lens Silver from Star Tech</h2><p>In Bangladesh, you can get an original <strong>FUJIFILM X-E4 Mirrorless Camera with 27mm Lens Silver</strong> From Star Tech.

This camera, which tops the X System, combines the intuitiveness, design, and image quality that FUJIFILM is recognized for with a new, quick approach to video and continuous shooting applications.</p><h3>X-Trans 5 Stacked BSI Sensor</h3><p>The X-H2S is the first X Series camera to utilize a stacked sensor, with an APS-C-format 26.1MP X-Trans 5 stacked BSI sensor that enhances readout rates and low-light performance over prior generations. First, as an X-Trans sensor, it employs a unique color filter array that reduces moiré and contributes to more natural color rendering; second, the BSI design reduces noise and improves tonality and clarity; and, finally, the stacked design greatly reduces rolling shutter and other motion distortion to better suit high-speed video and photo photo applications.</p><h3>X-Processor 5</h3><p>In addition to the newly built sensor, the X-Processor 5 features 64-bit processing of <strong>X-H2S</strong> to provide 3x quicker rates for both video and picture activities than the X-T4. On the video side, this permits recording at up to 6.2K with high bitrates, such as ProRes 422 HQ, or at high speeds, such as 240 fps Full HD recording. On the stills side, quicker processing implies faster shooting to accommodate capturing moving subjects. Shooting at up to 40 frames per second is possible when using an electronic shutter, with a buffer of 140 consecutive uncompressed raw frames. Shooting speeds of up to 15 frames per second are feasible with the mechanical shutter, as is the capacity to shoot up to 1000 raw shots in a single burst.</p><h3>4K 120p and 6.2K 30p Internal Recording</h3><p>The X-H2S features a well-rounded recording mechanism that positions this camera solidly in the 'hybrid' category and works equally well for video as it does for photo. Internal 4:2:2 10-bit recording in DCI/UHD 4K at up to 120p and Full HD at up to 240p, as well as an open-gate 3:2 6.2K option appropriate for anamorphic applications, is possible. H.265 and three ProRes tiers are also supported, including the high bandwidth 422 HQ, the normal 422, and the more compressed 422 LT. At all frame rates and resolutions, continuous recording lengths of up to 90 minutes are feasible.</p><h3>External Raw Recording</h3><p>When linked X-H2S with a suitable external recorder, raw video recording via the full-size HDMI connector is available. Both ProRes RAW and Blackmagic RAW recording are supported, as well as working with F-Log or F-Log 2 profiles and working at resolutions up to the open-gate 6.2K.</p><h3>Hybrid AF with Deep Learning AI</h3><p>Autofocus performance is substantially quicker and more intelligent as a result of the increased processing. This hybrid focusing technology employs 425 phase-detection points and is now sensitive down to -7 EV, allowing it to function in really low-light circumstances.

Imaging-wise, the X-Pro3 has an APS-C-format 26.1MP X-Trans CMOS 4 sensor and an X-Processor 4, which allow for DCI/UHD 4K video recording and high-resolution still photography. An ISO 160–12800 sensitivity range is also made possible by the sensor and CPU, allowing for operation in a range of illumination scenarios. The X-Pro3's advanced design, which incorporates the Hybrid Multi Viewfinder, which combines an optical and an electronic 3.69 million dot OLED viewfinder, is one of its strongest points. With the dedicated lever on the front of the camera, you can quickly switch between these two viewing choices, giving you the ability to select between the accuracy and variety of an EVF and the ease of use and speed of an OVF. A revised back LCD design with a covert 180° tilting touchscreen with 1.62m-dot resolution is also present in the FUJIFILM X-Pro3. When not in use, the bigger 3.0\" screen is kept concealed behind the body thanks to the innovative fold-down screen design, and a smaller settings display is accessible while shooting.  </p><h3>26.1MP APS-C X-Trans BSI CMOS 4 Sensor and X-Processor 4</h3><p>The X-Trans CMOS 4 sensor, which has a back-illuminated design to provide smooth tonal reproduction, enhanced low-light performance, and a low native ISO 160 setting, is an APS-C-format 26.1MP sensor used in the <strong>X-Pro3</strong>. Because it is an X-Trans sensor, it also uses a randomized pixel array, which eliminates the need for an optical low-pass filter and results in very crisp and high-quality images. The X-Trans design more closely resembles the organic nature of film than traditional pixel patterns, which helps to reduce moiré and aliasing and provide subtle hues and tonal shifts. An extended phase-detection autofocus system with 425 customizable points that covers almost the whole sensor surface is also a feature of the sensor's design. </p><h3>Hybrid Multi Viewfinder</h3><p>A crisp, realistic picture of the scene is provided by the optical viewfinder, making subject tracking and composition simpler. The improved design includes an Electronic Rangefinder feature that functions similarly to a mechanical rangefinder while also superimposing data from the electronic viewfinder over the optical viewfinder to provide manual focus adjustment that is more comparable. The electronic viewfinder of FUJIFILM X-Pro3 has a rapid playback speed of 100 frames per second (fps) and a high 3.69 million dot resolution to minimize latency and provide better tracking and panning motions. In addition to having a display that can be customized to change the type and quantity of information displayed in the viewfinder, the EVF allows you to evaluate exposure settings before shooting. </p><h3>UHD and DCI 4K Video Recording</h3><p>The <strong>X-Pro3</strong> is more than just a stills camera; it has an alluring variety of video features, such as internal DCI/UHD 4K recording at up to 30 frames per second. The speed of the X-Processor 4 significantly improves overall video performance by allowing high read rates in 4K footage and assisting in the reduction of rolling shutter distortion while capturing moving objects. A 2.5mm external microphone port is also included on the camera for more sophisticated audio options.</p><h3>Film Simulation and Grain Effect Modes</h3><p>Utilizing FUJIFILM's extensive background in conventional film-based photography, the X-Pro3 has many Film Simulation modes. These modes imitate the appearance and feel of some of FUJIFILM's classic film types: Classic Chrome, which is intended to produce muted tones and a deep color reproduction, akin to that of an antiquated slide film; Acros, which offers smooth tones, deep blacks, and fine detail; and Eterna, which replicates the look of cinematic film with subdued colors and richer shadow tones. There are several other effects that may be used for both color and monochrome photography. A Grain Effect setting is also available to mimic the appearance of vintage film images with an organic grainy appearance, which is particularly visible when printing, in addition to replicating specific film types.</p><h2>Buy FUJIFILM X-Pro3 Mirrorless Camera (Body Only) from the best Camera Shop in BD</h2><p>In Bangladesh, you can get an original <strong>FUJIFILM X-Pro3 Mirrorless Camera (Body Only)</strong> From Star Tech.

DCI 4K30 and Full HD 1080p120 recordings are also supported, and video files may be stored in MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 or HEVC/H.265 compression, as well as 4K. The quad-CPU X-Processor 4's speed greatly improves overall video performance by enabling quick read rates of 17 ms while recording 4K60 footage, which helps to decrease rolling shutter distortion when capturing moving objects. The X-T3 has the F-Log gamma setting, which produces a flat image for use in advanced color grading applications during editing, in addition to the supporting 10-bit color depth. This increases the possible dynamic range in tough circumstances, and picture modifications to highlight tone, shadow tone, color, and sharpness may also be done. Working in F-Log now includes an improved noise reduction algorithm as well as 4K inter-frame noise reduction, and the minimum sensitivity has been reduced to ISO 640 to accommodate working in a wider range of scene types.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Body Design</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">A 3.69m-dot OLED electronic viewfinder provides a high 0.75x magnification, rapid 100 fps refresh rate, broad viewing angle, and lockable diopter adjustment. The viewfinder is blackout-free while shooting at up to 30 frames per second, and a special Sports Finder Mode can also be used, which highlights a 16.6MP crop area of the sensor to allow you to see outside of the image frame. A rear 3.0\" 1.04m-dot LCD touchscreen is offered in addition to the EVF for easy live view shooting, playback and review, settings modification, and menu navigation. The screen also includes a three-way tilting design to accommodate working from high and low angles while filming horizontally or vertically. Dual SD card slots provide a more versatile and dependable way of storing imagery, and both card slots are UHS-II compliant for rapid transfer speeds. The top plate features several locking dials and levers for quick, simple exposure control, including a shutter speed dial for direct shutter speed change. The shutter speed dial includes an ISO dial for validating the sensitivity setting without turning on the camera, and the exposure compensation dial allows you to pick +/- 3 EV in 1/3 increments, with a command dial position expanding the range to +/- 5 EV for even more flexibility.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Modes for Film Simulation and Grain Effect</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The X-T3 incorporates multiple Film Simulation modes, leveraging Fujifilm's extensive experience with conventional film-based photography. These modes are designed to replicate the look and feel of some of Fujifilm's classic film types, such as Eterna, which mimics the look of cinematic film with understated colors and richer shadow tones; Acros, which offers smooth tones, deep blacks, and fine detail; and Classic Chrome, which is designed to diver muted tones and deep color reproduction, similar to that of dated slide film. Other effects are available for both monochrome and color photography. A Grain Effect setting, in addition to mimicking specific film types, is available to imitate the look of antique film images with an organic grainy appearance, which is notably visible when printing.</p><h2 style=\"\">Buy&nbsp;FUJIFILM X-T3 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Body Only) from the best Camera Shop in BD</h2><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In Bangladesh, you can get an original <a href=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/fujifilm-x-t3-mirrorless-digital-camera\" target=\"\">FUJIFILM X-T3 Mirrorless Digital Camera</a> From Star Tech.
