That means it’s not only useful across a broad range of subjects, but it can also be used in all sorts of challenging lighting conditions.

This lens however has been designed with no compromise, so the image quality is comparable to that of a prime lens. This lens is built to offer the versatility of a zoom lens with the ultimate image quality altogether.</p><h2>Multiple features with great functionality</h2><p>This XF 16-55mm f2.8 R LM WR Camera Lens manages to strike the perfect balance of sharpness with smooth bokeh. It delivers true to life colors that is never seen before in a zoom lens. The zoom uses leading-edge optical technology and lens coatings that draws on Fujifilm’s esteemed heritage in optical design. Fujifilm's proprietary (High Transmittance Electron Beam Coating) is used to eliminate reflections and Nano GI coating is applied to control ghosting and flare caused by light bouncing around inside the lens. In doing so, this cutting-edge technology improves the quality of light hitting the sensor, which increases overall image quality. The XF 16-55mm R LM WR Camera Lens also uses a rounded, nine-bladed aperture design to provide smooth and circular bokeh for outstanding subject separation.</p><h2>Less Boundaries </h2><p>FUJIFILM XF 16-55mm f2.8 R LM WR Camera Lens has these features mean this lens delivers the perfect balance of edge-to-edge sharpness, exceptional background blur, and true-to-life color in every part of its zoom range.

It has a basic construction with three aspherical elements to reduce distortions and spherical aberrations, while three extra-low dispersion elements are also used to control chromatic aberrations and increase clarity.</p><h2>Cover every angle</h2><p>Normally, you would need to carry four XF prime lenses to replicate the focal range of this zoom lens. However with the FUJIFILM XF 16-55mm f2.8 R LM WR Camera Lens, you get every mm in between 16mm and 55mm to fine tune your composition even more. This convenience while maintaining amazing image quality gives you an extra advantage versus carrying four fixed focal length lenses. A standard zoom like the FUJIFILM XF 16-55mm R LM WR Camera Lens lets you cover without changing lenses. From wide angle to short telephoto, this is a small lens with huge scope. At 16mm, you can record every detail in big landscape scenes, towering architecture, or cramped interiors. Zoom in to 24mm or 35mm and you've got a perfect lens for groups, street, or documentary photos. And up around 50mm, you’re perfectly placed for portraits and close-ups.</p><h2>Smooth day-to-day comforting usage</h2><p>All of the XF 16-55mm R LM WR Camera Lens’s versatility and image quality would be for nothing without great AF performance to back it up. This lens uses a high-speed linear motor that can focus as fast as 0.02 seconds, so it will react to the moment just as fast as you do. Combine the fast AF with Fujifilm’s Face/Eye Detection AF technology for perfect portraits, or use it in Zone or Tracking mode on action subjects.

The constant f/4 maximum aperture and sophisticated optics of this 15-36mm equivalent zoom are its defining features. These optics correct both chromatic and spherical aberrations for high color accuracy, sharpness, and precise rendering by employing a number of extra-low dispersion and aspherical elements. When working in bright illumination, a Super EBC coating also reduces flare and ghosting for better contrast and color neutrality. A stepping motor provides fast and silent focusing performance, and an upgraded optical image stabilization technology reduces the appearance of camera shake by 3.5 stops for better sharpness when shooting handheld. </p><h3>Best of Wide-Angle View</h3><p>The <strong>XF 10-24mm F/4</strong> R OIS WR is a small, wide-angle zoom lens that covers the entire range of traditional 35mm wide-angle focal lengths in a single lens. Its 35mm equivalent focal range is 15–36mm.

A new and advanced gyro sensor enhances the <strong>XF 10-24mm F/4</strong> R OIS WR's stability by one stop over its previous version of Optical Image Stabilization (OIS). With this, vibration reduction performance is increased to 3.5 stops, and when combined with an existing X Series camera that has in-body image stabilization (IBIS), such as the FUJIFILM X-T4, it can be further increased to 6.5 stops. One thing is for sure: stable, handheld photographs are coming, regardless of the camera used.</p><h3>Constant Evolution to Expand Possibilities</h3><p>In addition to weather resistance, which essentially shields the XF 10-24mm F/4 R OIS WR from dust and moisture, the most recent version of this lens has a number of other enhancements. For instance, the aperture ring now features an A-position lock to prevent unintentional adjustments to the lens's aperture settings. In order to enable aperture settings to be examined without the use of on-screen displays, a new aperture scale has also been added to the aperture ring. Lastly, the lens weighs 25g (0.9 oz) less overall than its predecessor thanks to a 1mm reduction in the breadth of the focus and aperture rings. </p><img src=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/image/catalog/lens/fujifilm/xf-10-24mm/xf-10-24mm-002.jpg\" alt=\"FUJIFILM XF 10-24mm f/4 R OIS WR Lens\" width=\"920\" height=\"450\"><h2>Buy FUJIFILM XF 10-24mm f/4 R OIS WR Lens from Star Tech</h2><p>In Bangladesh, you can get the original <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">FUJIFILM XF 10-24mm f/4 R OIS WR Lens from Star</span> Tech.
