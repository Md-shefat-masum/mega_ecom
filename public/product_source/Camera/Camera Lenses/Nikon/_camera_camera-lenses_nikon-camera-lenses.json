This Special Edition lens is inspired by the vintage NIKKOR lenses launched around the same time as the Nikon FM2 film SLR camera, with elements such as knurling and a prominent control ring that authentically mimic the designs of the time. The lens is intended to be a flexible wide-angle lens suitable for a variety of topics such as landscape, architectural, and reportage. This quick, bright lens with an f/2.8 maximum aperture provides stunning details at a normal focal length. In addition to the optical design, a multi-focus system with two stepping motors aids in achieving extremely quick, precise, and silent focus performance, as well as full-time manual focus override for both stills and video applications. A programmable control ring may also be configured for straightforward modification of a number of camera and exposure parameters. It's a terrific lens to have on hand for unplanned situations at any time of day.  </p><h3>Autofocus Features</h3><p>Two fast-stepping autofocus motors work almost silently. The internal focus lens has a rear-focus design that separates the components into specialized lens groups for focusing, with just the rear lens group moving for quicker, smoother operation. The focus groups' positions are accurately regulated, resulting in exceptionally accurate and fast AF control.</p><h3>Multi-Focus System</h3><p>The focus groups' positions are accurately regulated, resulting in exceptionally accurate and fast AF control. Furthermore, exceptional imaging performance is given across the full shooting range, even close distances, by efficiently eliminating aberrations with  <strong>NIKKOR Z 28mm Lens</strong>.</p><h3>Super Integrated Lens Coating</h3><p>A multilayer lens coating of NIKKOR Z 28mm Lens provides good transmittance across a wider wavelength range.
