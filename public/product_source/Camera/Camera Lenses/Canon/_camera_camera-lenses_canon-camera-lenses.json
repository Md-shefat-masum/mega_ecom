At just 2.36 pounds, it's easy to pack and carry wherever you go. The portable Canon RF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS USM Lens is an essential lens for your bag, ready to capture everything from faraway wildlife to portraits, and more.</p><h3>Constant f/2.8 Aperture</h3><p>Bright f/2.8 constant maximum aperture maintains consistent illumination throughout the zoom range and suits working in low-light conditions as well as affords increased control over depth of field for working with selective focus techniques. Rounded nine-blade diaphragm contributes to a pleasing bokeh quality.
