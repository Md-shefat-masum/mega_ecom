The maximum aperture range of f/5.6-6.3 helps to decrease size and weight while giving great performance in several situations. When shooting handheld with shorter shutter rates, optical SteadyShot image stabilization helps to reduce the impression of camera wobble for better pictures.  OSS has three dedicated modes, including panning and viewfinder stabilization priority settings, and can also be combined with a select camera's sensor-shift type image stabilization for more effective control of camera blur.

Its compact form makes it perfect for a walkaround, and everyday shooting, and its versatile focal length range advantages a wide range of subject types, from street photography to portraits to trip photography. This lens is all about the small size and lightweight construction, making it the ideal partner for casual photography days when a single, adaptable, and portable lens is most needed.

This model combines enhanced G Lens bokeh with higher levels of resolution to provide a really excellent portrait lens that can take full advantage of the capability of current and future high-resolution camera systems. The Sony FE 85mm f/1.4 GM is a quick short-telephoto prime with a pleasing field of view, sophisticated optics, and the ability to isolate subjects with shallow depth of field. This G Master lens provides improved sharpness and exceptional quality, advocating a pleasant image quality well-suited for portraits, events, and other scenarios where focus control is essential.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Extraordinary resolution and bokeh</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sony FE 85mm Camera Lens has excellent sharpness even at maximum F1.4 aperture and presents the subject with amazing dimensionality. The background is then gradually transformed into an artistic backdrop with natural coloration and highlighted by exquisite bokeh. This uncommon mix, made possible in part by new XA element technology, allows up new avenues for visual creativity. When zoomed, constant aperture preserves exposure and depth of field regardless of focal range. When the aperture is changed to defocus the backdrop, the portions outside of the focal plane seem blurry. The circular aperture blades employed in this lens can improve the bokeh effect of the blurred backdrop.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Natural images with no spurious color</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chromatic aberration can degrade resolution as well as bokeh quality. Three ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass elements make a significant contribution to this Sony FE 85mm Camera lens’s outstanding optical performance, keeping overriding chromatic aberration in check while maximizing both clarity and the natural look and color of its breathtaking bokeh. This is the first α lens to incorporate 11 blades in a circular aperture design, taking bokeh quality to new levels of smooth beauty with natural looking highlights.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sublime 2-sensor autofocus accuracy</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Sony FE 85mm Camera Lens has a rotation sensor as is customary, and a second sensor that measures focus lens group position. To fully utilize the high-resolution capabilities of modern camera bodies, this dual sensor system achieves the extremely high level of focus precision required. The necessary power and speed is provided by the RDSSM (Ring Drive Super Sonic wave Motor) drive.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Outstanding clarity and contrast</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This Sony FE 85mm Lens delivers advanced Nano AR Coating technology which produces a lens coating with a precisely defined regular nano-structure that effectively suppresses reflections that can cause flare and ghosting, for notable improvements in clarity, contrast, and overall image quality.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">High reliability in harsh conditions</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition to the normal dust and moisture sealing measures, a seal has been added at the lens-body interface for even further protection and reliability in challenging environments.

A revised optical design successfully removes axial shift, focus breathing, and focus shift to stop undesired movements and changes in angle of vision when filming.</p><h3>Handling and Design</h3><p>This incredibly adaptable ultra-wide standard zoom is lightweight, portable which provides a distinctive, broad field of view for daily photography. The hybrid structure of <strong>FE 20-70mm</strong> optimizes low weight and durability by utilizing both plastic and metal components.

The lens has F1.2 maximum aperture that not only allows shooting in a wider range of lighting conditions, but also provides an extraordinary combination of high resolution, luscious G Master bokeh, and blazing autofocus. It is also remarkably compact and lightweight, for new creative freedom.</p><h3>G Master resolution without compromise</h3><p>The Sony FE 50mm Camera Lens is an ideal choice for dedicated creators. XA (extreme aspherical) elements and other advanced technologies combine to achieve extraordinary resolution and contrast from the image center right out to the edges. Sony’s Nano AR Coating II subdues flare and ghosting, while a floating focus mechanism ensure optimum sharpness at any focusing distance.</p><h3>Smooth, refined G Master bokeh</h3><p>Gorgeous G Master bokeh is made possible by XA elements and painstaking spherical aberration control during the design and manufacturing phases. This is especially true given the shallow depth of field possible at the lens' maximum F1.2 aperture, which can really make portrait and other subjects stand out. A beautiful circular bokeh is produced by an 11-blade circular aperture mechanism.</p><h3>Fast, precise, quiet AF and tracking</h3><p>Sony FE 50mm Camera Lens is fast and accurate focused, even with extremely shallow 50mm F1.2 depth of field. Four XD (extreme dynamic) Linear Motors smoothly deliver high thrust to position the large, heavy focus groups for fast, accurate AF. Original Sony E-mount lens technology ensures that you get maximum performance from E-mount bodies, for both stills and movies. 87 mm (3-1/2 in.) in diameter, 108 mm (4-3/8 in.) long, and weighing just 778 grams (27.5 oz.), the FE 50mm F1.2 GM complements compact, high-performance E-mount bodies to create a system that gives serious shooters the mobility and handling. Three XA elements and four XD Linear Motors in a large-aperture lens that is surprisingly compact offer extraordinary creative potential.</p><h3>Professional control and reliability</h3><p>This Sony FE 50mm Camera lens has two focus hold buttons, a focus mode switch, a focus ring, an aperture ring with switchable click stops and other controls support smooth operation.
