Ideal for corporate video, house of worship, and legal deposition recordings. The camcorder has a single Exmor RS sensor with UHD 4K (3840 x 2160) resolution, a Sony G lens with 12x optical zoom, and 18/24x Clear Image Zoom in 4K/HD. It can record 4K in XAVC Long at 4:2:0 8-bit, HD in XAVC Long at 4:2:2 10-bit at 50 Mb/s, and MPEG2HD at 4:2:2 or 4:2:0 in 8-bit. The integrated zoom lens has distinct lens control rings for focus, iris, and zoom, and it creates beautiful, rounded out-of-focus highlights. The camcorder can store up to 6 picture profiles and share them; it also supports Sony's Slow and Quick Motion for capturing HD video at a variety of frame rates, including 120 fps. The camcorder can record to a number of formats, frame rates, and codecs, including 100 Mb/s XAVC Long GOP of 4K UHD video at up to 29.97p, HD at up to 59.94p, MPEG HD at up to 59.94p, and AVCHD 2.0 at up to 59.94p. Your film is recorded to media using two SD memory card slots. You may record concurrently on both cards or use the relay mode, which automatically switches recording to the second memory card when the first one is full. It includes Wi-Fi and NFC connection.  </p><h3>1\" Exmor RS CMOS Sensor</h3><p>The PXW-Z150 features a 1.0\" Exmor RS CMOS sensor with over 14.2 million effective pixels. The R designation indicates that this is a backside-illuminated sensor, while the S designation refers to the buffer design and the ability to read information from the sensor significantly quicker than a non-S designated sensor.</p><h3>Sony G Lens with 12x Optical Zoom, 24x Clear Image Zoom</h3><p>The <strong>PXW-Z150</strong> comes with a fixed 12x optical zoom wide-angle Sony G lens, which corresponds to a 29 to 348mm 35mm lens. Sony's Clear Image Zoom technology extends the 12x optical zoom capability to an apparent 18x in 4K. The 12x optical zoom in HD can be increased to 24x with Clear Image Zoom, and the Digital Extender feature can increase this range to 48x zoom.</p><h3>Frame Rate Flexibility</h3><p>The camera captures UHD 4K video (3840 x 2160p) at 29.97, 25, and 23.98 fps in XAVC Long GOP at speeds of 100 or 60 Mb/s. You may also choose to record HD video instead of 4K, which allows you to record at conventional frame rates up to 59.94p while also utilizing Sony's S&amp;Q Motion to record HD video at 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, 30, and 60 fps.</p><h3>Lens Control</h3><p>Three lens rings allow for smooth, natural adjustment of focus, zoom, and iris. Although the rings are not technically related to the lens movement, they nevertheless have a mechanical sensation. However, they revolve indefinitely, protecting your lens elements from pinning, and the faster you move the lens ring, the more reactive the outcome. For ultimate creative freedom, the lens may be set to full-auto or entirely manual mode.</p><h2>Buy Sony PXW-Z150 4K XDCAM Camcorder from Star Tech</h2><p>In Bangladesh, you can get the original <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Sony PXW-Z150 4K XDCAM Camcorder</span> from Star Tech.
