With a 24.1MP APS-C-format CMOS sensor and DIGIC 8 image processor, the camera supports high-resolution stills and UHD 4K video recording, as well as a wide ISO 100-25600 sensitivity range for working in a variety of lighting scenarios. The sensor's design facilitates Dual Pixel CMOS AF, which uses phase-detection autofocus for quick, accurate, and smooth focusing performance when recording movies or shooting stills in live view. A 45-point all cross-type phase-detection system is employed for rapid and precise focusing in a range of shooting conditions while shooting stills with the optical viewfinder. The physical design includes a 3.0\" 1.04m-dot touchscreen LCD with a vari-angle design that allows for easier reading from high, low, and even front-facing angles. In addition, built-in Wi-Fi with NFC allows for quick and easy connection with a smartphone or tablet for wireless image sharing, and Bluetooth is included for image sharing and remote camera control from a mobile device.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">24.1MP APS-C CMOS Sensor and DIGIC 8 Image Processor</h3><p>The Canon EOS 850D DSLR Camera has exceptional sensitivity and fast performance for both stills and video applications, thanks to a 24.1MP APS-C CMOS sensor and DIGIC 8 image processor. The ISO 100-25600 native range is perfect for working in a variety of lighting conditions, and the processing capabilities reduce noise for notable clarity and extensible sensitivity up to ISO 51200. To handle moving subjects, the CPU offers up to 7 fps continuous shooting and UHD 4K video recording.</p><h3>UHD 4K Video Recording</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">In addition to stills, the T8i also sports UHD 4K video recording at up to 24 fps, as well as Full HD and HD recording, and supports vertical video output for vlogging applications. Video recording is benefitted from the inclusion of Dual Pixel CMOS AF and the Movie Servo AF focusing functions, as well as the touchscreen design of the LCD monitor for intuitive control. Movie Digital IS also helps to steady recordings by minimizing the appearance of camera shake across five axes for smoother footage. Additionally, an external microphone jack is incorporated into the body design for greater control over your recorded sound.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">45-Point All Cross-Type AF and Dual Pixel CMOS AF Systems</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The Canon EOS 850D DSLR Camera Benefiting from stills shooting with the optical viewfinder, a wide-area 45-point all cross-type phase-detection autofocus system enables rapid and precise focusing in low-light circumstances. The sensors' cross-type construction allows for higher accuracy in low-contrast and mixed illumination circumstances, and the 45 sensors' broad coverage is perfect for tracking and maintaining focus on moving targets. Additionally, EOS iTR AF prioritizes recognized faces in a scene to ensure precise focus during portrait photography.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><br></p><h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, sans-serif;\">Buy a&nbsp;</span>Canon EOS 850D DSLR Camera (Body Only) from the best Camera Shop in Bangladesh: Star Tech</h2><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In Bangladesh, you can get the original&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/canon-eos-850d-dslr-camera-body\" target=\"\" style=\"\">Canon EOS 850D DSLR Camera (Body Only)</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;From Star Tech.

Great for those times when you need to be right in amongst the action. Full resolution pictures from the 32.5-megapixel EOS 90D can be cropped, rotated, and resized with image quality detailed enough for large prints. Find scenes within a scene and adjust your composition for the perfect result. Reveal the moments itâ€™s impossible to see with the naked eye, shooting 32.5-megapixel images at up to 10 frames per second. High ISO sensitivities (up to ISO 25,600) let you freeze action with breathtakingly fast shutter speeds, as a quick as 1/8000sec. The EOS 90D has a bright, approx.100% coverage optical viewfinder that lets you view action as it happens and makes it easier to track fast-moving subjects, such as birds in flight. An intelligent customizable display shows key shooting information, so you always know whatâ€™s happening even when the pressure is on. EOS 90Dâ€™s Vari-Angle touchscreen lets you shoot comfortably from different angles. You can focus and shoot with a single tap, making this a very intuitive way to work. Even the quickest subjects are tracked and kept pin-sharp, thanks to an advanced autofocusing system. 45 cross-type AF points work with a 220,000-pixel RGB+IR exposure sensor for outstanding low-light sensitivity as well as subject recognition. The EOS 90D is the latest in a long line of DSLRs from Canon, each one a refinement and evolution on the last. This re-assuring yet customisable design feels instinctive from the moment you pick it up â€“ controls fall perfectly under fingers and thumbs and the camera is very well balanced with both long telephoto and short, wide-angle lenses from Canonâ€™s extensive range of optics. Built-in Bluetooth and Wi-Fi adds another dimension to your creativity. The EOS 90D works together with smart devices running the Canon Camera Connect app* to make it easy to share images via messaging and social media. Itâ€™s also possible to control the camera remotely, for alternative viewpoints. The EOS 90D is superb filmmaking tool, with the ability to shoot resolutions up to 4K and frame rates up to 120p in Full HD mode.
