The sling mode design consists of a handle on the rear that allows for easy switching to underslung mode as well as better handling in all other modes. Other improvements include upgraded motors and stabilization algorithm. The WEEBILL-S features 300% more motor torque and 50% more responsiveness. This allows you to better balance camera/lens combos such as the Canon 5D Mark IV with a 24-70mm zoom lens.<br></p><p>Being released along with the WEEBILL-S as an optional accessory is the TransMount Image Transmission Module, a compact device designed to neatly mount under the quick release plate of the WEEBILL-S and allow wireless streaming of up to 1080p30 resolution over distances up to 328'. Up to three devices, including phones, tablets, and select professional monitors, can be synced up using corresponding receiver modules.<br></p><p>The companion Zhiyun-Tech ZY Play app, compatible with iOS and Android, has been upgraded to work with the Image Transmission Module to allow more efficient control of the gimbal. A feature in the app called SmartFollow 2.0 works with the module to allow precision object tracking directly from the app. A tool called Sync Motion enables real-time monitoring and synchronous motion control. There are also upgrades to standard features, including ViaTouch 2.0, which allows you to control various functions and settings of your camera and gimbal directly from your smartphone screen. These include zoom and focus, where supported, as well as follow speed, ISO, aperture, and more. Other features you'll find in the ZY Play app include creative capture tools such as Panorama, Timelapse, Motionlapse, and Long Exposure Timelapse, among others.<br></p><p>The WEEBILL-S offers six modes of operation. These include Full-Range POV Mode, which allows 360Â° synchronous movement on all three axes, and Vortex Mode, which lets you achieve 360Â° barrel shots. Please see the Features section below for a description of all six modes. Other features of the gimbal include Intelligent Auto-Tune, which automatically recognizes the weight of your camera and adapts to the weight to provide the best power efficiency possible.

The CRANE 2S can stabilize big cameras like the Blackmagic Pocket 6K, Panasonic S1H, and Canon EOS 1DX Mark II, as well as accessories, thanks to its innovative 9th Instune Algorithm, which increases the response of each axis. (A complete list of compatible cameras and lenses may be seen on the Zhiyun website. The CRANE 2S has specialized mounting hooks for adding an optional Zhiyun-Tech TransMount transmitter to allow a collaborative approach. Another new feature is a vertical quick-release mount, which allows you to place your camera up vertically to satisfy the increased need for social media material. Aside from that, new FlexMount technology is employed to mount your camera traditionally. This technology streamlines the mounting and setup procedure while also providing double-safety protection for your camera. A two-phase locking design has also been developed on the axis-locking mechanism for balancing a camera. The axis-locking mechanism also guarantees that the gimbal components do not shift during transport or storage. The gimbal's grip handle is composed of carbon fiber, making it seem lighter in your hand. The built-in handwheel on the side of the handle has been updated to enable a very minimal latency when operating an add-on lens motor, which is supplied separately, allowing for more precise adjustments. (If you're utilizing both a focus and a zoom motor, you may use the handwheel to adjust which one you use.) A 1/4\"-20 thread on the bottom of the handle allows you to attach the accompanying micro tripod as a stand or an extension that may be held with the other hand for better control. Advanced cinematic capabilities including panorama, time-lapse, motion-lapse and long exposure time-lapse may be done with the gimbal using the associated iOS/Android mobile app to generate unique effects. Many of the gimbal's characteristics may be tweaked through the app, and many critical modes and parameters can be accessed directly from the 0.96\" OLED screen above the handle. Servo motors are among the specialized Zhiyun-Tech TransMount accessories that may be used with the CRANE 2S. The gimbal's fast-release plate is compatible with a wide range of tripod heads, allowing you to quickly switch between the gimbal and tripods, sliders, and other camera supports. A lens control and numerous camera control connections are also supplied for a complete workflow. The CRANE 2S is powered by three included batteries that may last up to 12 hours and can be recharged using the included triple charger. It offers 1 year service warranty (Motor broken will be considered as physical damage, customer will not get any service warranty).</p>","specifications":[{"heading":"General","values":[{"key":"Dimension","value":"453x230x68mm (Folded, without quick release plate)"},{"key":"Weight","value":"4.1lbs (Tripod and Battery is not included)"},{"key":"Compatibility","value":"Sony: A9 II, A9, A7R4, A7R3, A7M3, A7S3, A7R2, A7M2, A7S2, Α7C, A6600, A6500, A6400, A6300, A6100, A6000"}]},{"heading":"Warranty","values":[{"key":"Warranty","value":"1 year service warranty (Motor broken will be considered as physical damage, customer will not get any service warranty)"}]}],"latest_price":{"heading":"What is the price of Zhiyun Weebill 2S 3-Axis Gimbal Stabilizer in Bangladesh?","paragraph":"The latest price of Zhiyun Weebill 2S 3-Axis Gimbal Stabilizer in Bangladesh is 40,500৳.

It's about 25% lighter and more compact thanks to monocoque carbon fiber axis arms and a shorter grip handle with a smaller battery cartridge, although still with a 12-hour runtime. The motors are about 20% more powerful and support cameras such as the Blackmagic Pocket 6K, Canon 1D X Mark III, Sony a7S III, and ALEXA Mini LF. The RS 2 also has a 1.4\" full-color LCD touchscreen that allows you to access gimbal settings as well as features such as time-lapse and hyperlapse, which were previously accessible only via the companion mobile app. The RS 2 uses the DJI Titan stabilization algorithm to provide improved stabilization with increased smoothness. In applications with up to 100mm zoom lenses, a built-in feature called SuperSmooth complements the algorithm by compensating for micromovements and increasing torque to achieve fluid motion (an optional lens support is required). The RS 2 comes with a splash-proof carry case designed with dedicated compartments for the different parts of the gimbal and key accessories. A mini tripod is also included and attaches to a 1/4\"-20 thread on the bottom of the grip handle to function as a stand or an extension handle for two-handed maneuvering of the gimbal in certain scenarios. This DJI RS 2 Gimbal Stabilizer Pro Combo has no warranty. <br></p>","specifications":[{"heading":"General","values":[{"key":"Dimension","value":"Folded: 260×265×70 mm (excluding the BG30 grip)"},{"key":"Weight","value":"Gimbal: Approx. 960 g (2.12 lbs) (excluding the Quick-Release Plates and Camera Mounting Plate)"},{"key":"Model","value":"BG30-1950mAh-15.4V"}]},{"heading":"Battery","values":[{"key":"Type","value":"LiPo 4S"},{"key":"Capacity","value":"1950 mAh"},{"key":"Voltage","value":"15.4V"},{"key":"Charging Temperature","value":"5°C to 40°C"},{"key":"Operating Temperature","value":"-20° to 45° C (-4° to 113° F)"},{"key":"Operating Time","value":"12 h"},{"key":"Charging Time","value":"1.5 h (24W USB adapter using the QC 2.0 or PD protocol)"}]},{"heading":"Gimbal","values":[{"key":"Mechanical Range","value":"Pan axis control: 360° continuous rotation"},{"key":"Max Controllable Speed","value":"Pan: 360°/s"},{"key":"Maximum Load","value":"4.5 kg (10.0 lbs)"},{"key":"Wireless","value":"Bluetooth 5.0"}]},{"heading":"Warranty","values":[{"key":"Warranty","value":"No Warranty"}]}],"latest_price":{"heading":"What is the price of DJI RS 2 Gimbal Stabilizer in Bangladesh?","paragraph":"The latest price of DJI RS 2 Gimbal Stabilizer in Bangladesh is 70,000৳.
