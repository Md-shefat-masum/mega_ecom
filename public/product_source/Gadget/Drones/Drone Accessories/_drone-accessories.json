This precisely produced filter set comprises a Circular Polarizer (CPL), ND8, and ND16 filter, all of which are meant to maximize your images in different lighting circumstances. The filters are made of HD AGC optical glass, which was imported for its remarkable clarity and ability to recover real colors without adding any undesired color cast. This keeps your photographs in high definition and true-to-life quality. Furthermore, the filters are designed to decrease lens glare and reflections, thus improving overall image quality. These filters have 28 multi-layer coatings on both sides of the glass and are supplied with abrasion-resistant and hydrophobic nanoscale coatings. This technology not only enhances surface hardness for longevity, but also makes cleaning a breeze, letting you focus on getting the ideal photo without having to worry about smudges or marks. The CPL filter weighs only 6.9g and the ND filters individually weigh 5.4g thanks to a rigorous lightweight frame construction. This meticulous thought ensures that the filters pass stringent lightweight testing, ensuring that they will not impair the operation of your DJI Mavic 3 Pro gimbal. You may use these filters with confidence without jeopardizing the drone's flying stability. The Circular Polarizer (CPL) is designed to prevent unwanted glare from non-metallic reflective surfaces when shooting outdoors, effectively reducing glare and improving overall image quality. The ND8 and ND16 filters are specifically tailored to slow down the shutter speed by 3/4 f-stop, making them ideal for partly cloudy days and normal sunny days. These ND filters provide better control over shutter speed, allowing you to achieve the desired cinematic effects and image clarity in various lighting conditions. The K&amp;F Concept DJI Mavic 3 PRO filter set combines premium materials, advanced coating technology, and thoughtful design to elevate your aerial photography and videography to new heights.
