The high SPL value of 144 dB of the capsule enables the clear and distortion-free recording of powerful sound sources like as percussion, drums, amplifiers, and other instruments. The TLM 102 offers a smooth vocal presence while avoiding overt sibilance thanks to its 8 to 12 kHz treble boost. As opposed to most other polar responses, the mic's cardioid polar pattern produces directed sound pickup in front of the capsule and strong rejection behavior behind it, producing less background noise. Although extra pop filters are available for even greater control, the inbuilt pop shield suppresses breath sounds and voice plosives. The transformerless output stage of the TLM 102 provides resistance to electromagnetic interference while assisting the mic in producing a clear character with lots of bass reach.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Silky Tone</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The TLM 102 was created by Neumann as a versatile tool for voice and instrumental recordings. The vital 8–12 kHz range, which is highlighted by its precisely tuned sound signature, is particularly important for human voices. The voice is given a regal presence in the overall mix, and the recordings acquire the smooth grace typical of large-diaphragm microphones. Despite this, the TLM 102 maintains its user-friendliness and handles difficult consonants or sibilants expertly because of the built-in pop shield.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">No Problem with High Volume</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Neumann TLM 102 handles abrupt dynamics changes and high loudness changes without distortion. Because of this, it's a great option for drums and powerful amps. It reproduces sound pressure levels of up to 144 dB (such as a very loud trumpet at a distance of roughly 4\") with excellent clarity: wide open, with strong bass and polished treble.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Neumann Sound on a Budget</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Neumann TLM 102 represents world-class audio on a tight budget. Neumann reorganized the manufacturing process and eliminated non-essential features including pattern, pad, and low-cut switches. You'll notice what they didn't leave out the moment you hear the TLM 102: the Neumann sound, which stays true to its major inspirations.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Clear and Powerful</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The TLM series utilizes a transformerless output stage to provide a strong bass transmission all the way down to the lowest frequencies as well as a clear and direct sound that is extremely \"close\" to the acoustic source. The microphone is also robust to electromagnetic fields and lowers transmission losses thanks to its transformer-free output stage.</p><h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit;\">Buy </span>Neumann TLM 102 Large-Diaphragm Cardioid Condenser Studio Microphone<span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit;\">&nbsp;from Star Tech</span><br></h2><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">In Bangladesh, you can get the original&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/neumann-tlm-102-condenser-studio-microphone\" target=\"\">Neumann TLM 102 Large-Diaphragm Cardioid Condenser Studio Microphone</a>&nbsp;from Star Tech.

It has a U 87-based capsule coupled with faultless transformerless circuitry, enabling it to tolerate high SPLs of up to 138 dB without distortion while keeping very low self-noise of about 7 dBA. The combination of the transformerless output stage and heightened treble response makes the TLM 103 a great choice when the sound source needs to clearly cut through the mix. The mic's compact body is ideal for positioning it in tight spots such as over a snare, inside a kick drum, or in front of a small guitar amp. By utilizing a cardioid polar pattern, the mic can effectively reduce ambient noise or instrument bleed behind the mic. The TLM 103 comes with a secure, space-saving swivel mount and a wooden box.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Affordable Alternative to the U 87</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The TLM 103, which was first offered in 1997 as a less expensive replacement for the renowned U 87, has subsequently earned a place in the annals of design history. Today, the TLM 103 serves as the benchmark for evaluating modern studio microphones. The TLM 103 has a distinctly Neumann appearance because to its conventional, tapered head grille design.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Large-Diaphragm Capsule</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Neumann TLM 103 is a cardioid microphone with a large-diaphragm condenser capsule derived from the classic K67/87 capsule of the legendary Neumann U 87. However, the TLM 103 has a slightly more modern voicing with a wide presence boost for frequencies above 5 kHz.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Refined and Full Sound</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Its highly direct yet polished tone is ideal for singers and solo instruments that effortlessly stand out in the mix. The TLM 103, of course, also features the renowned authoritative midrange that has become the distinguishing feature of Neumann microphones and elevated them to a top option in studios all over the world. The TLM 103's remarkably deep yet controlled bottom end is one of its unique features; it is ideal for sonorous vocals and strong bass instruments.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Technical Excellence</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The TLM 103 is one of the quietest microphones on the market with an extraordinarily low self-noise of only 7 dBA. Additionally, even with low-cost preamps, audio interfaces, or old tube equipment, its exceptional sensitivity of -32.5 dBV guarantees extremely low noise. The TLM 103 can manage extremely high sound pressure levels of up to 138 dB simultaneously without the need for pre attenuation. The TLM 103 is a highly simple-to-use studio microphone because of its wide dynamic range of 131 dB, which can catch anything from a gentle whisper to a thunderous bass drum without introducing noise or distortion.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Transformerless Output</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The TLM 103 is a part of Neumann's TLM series and utilizes a transformerless output stage, minimizing transmission losses and guaranteeing a highly immediate, uncolored sound that is faithful to the original as well as a clear, strong bass response, even at the highest signal levels.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Applications</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Neumann TLM 103 was initially intended for project studios and broadcast use, but because of its exceptional performance, it was quickly adopted by prestigious studios as a more contemporary-sounding substitute for the U 87 for speech, vocals, drums, guitar amps, and piano. When recording cello and double bass in classical music, the TLM 103 is frequently utilized as a spot mic.</p><h2 style=\"\">Buy Neumann TLM 103 Large-Diaphragm Cardioid Condenser Studio Microphone from Star Tech</h2><p>In Bangladesh, you can get the original&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/neumann-tlm-103-condenser-studio-microphone\" target=\"\">Neumann TLM 103 Large-Diaphragm Cardioid Condenser Studio Microphone</a>&nbsp;from Star Tech.

The TLM 107's dual-diaphragm capsule, which was specially designed for it, provides a balanced tone that is constant across its five selectable polar patterns, making it an excellent choice for the uncolored recording of vocals and instruments. Changes to the polar pattern, pad (-6 or -12 dB), and low-cut filter (40 or 100 Hz) are made using a single control on the mic's back. The TLM 107 can be used with sound sources up to 153 dB when the -12 dB pad is engaged, making it possible to record percussion, drums, amplifiers, and other loud instruments without distortion. A treble boost above 8 kHz helps the mic maintain detail and articulation while avoiding pronounced sibilance. Thanks in part to the transformerless circuitry, the TLM 107 yields only 10 dBA of self-noise, further enhancing its transparent nature.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Pro-Level Accuracy for Home Studios</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">True high-definition sound quality is available at a reasonable cost with the Neumann TLM 107. This microphone was created by Neumann for project and home studio users who desire to record an uncolored sound picture that is faithful to the original source in order to maintain all post-processing and mixing possibilities. The TLM 107, on the other hand, has all the adaptability needed to produce a high-quality recording of any source in any circumstance.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Updated Looks and Controls</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The TLM 107 was given a modern makeover by Neumann, despite the fact that its broad, tapering headgrille resembles renowned Neumann designs from the past, such the M 49 tube microphone. In addition to controlling the low-cut filter (linear, 40 Hz, or 100 Hz) and polar patterns (omnidirectional, wide cardioid, cardioid, hypercardioid, or figure-8), the sleek navigation toggle on the back of the microphone is a delight to use.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dual-Diaphragm Capsule</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The newly developed dual-diaphragm condenser capsule is specially designed for the TLM 107 to offer an outstanding transient response and an extended, carefully balanced frequency response for all polar patterns. This means you can adjust the directional pattern according to the recording situation without affecting the overall sound balance, which is quite uncommon for a large-diaphragm microphone.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Neumann Engineering</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The TLM 107 is a part of Neumann's TLM series and uses a transformerless circuit to function, guaranteeing an open, transparent sound and a complete, unconstrained bass transmission even at maximum volume. To lessen rumbling and account for the proximity impact during close-miking, there are two low-cut options available. The TLM 107 can tolerate extremely high sound pressure levels of up to 141 dB without clipping (up to 153 dB with attenuation) even without using the two-pad settings. An extremely quiet recording studio's background noise is substantially louder than the TLM 107's self-noise, which is just 10 dBA. In other words, the TLM 107 won't amplify undesired distortion or add noise to your recordings.</p><h2><span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; text-align: justify;\">Buy&nbsp;</span><span style=\"text-align: justify;\">Neumann TLM 107 Large-Diaphragm Cardioid Condenser Studio Microphone<span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit;\">&nbsp;from Star Tech</span></span><br></h2><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">In Bangladesh, you can get the original&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/neumann-tlm-107-condenser-studio-microphone\" target=\"\">Neumann TLM 107 Large-Diaphragm Cardioid Condenser Studio Microphone</a>&nbsp;from Star Tech.

In addition, the mic has a switchable -10 dB pad that allows it to catch SPLs up to 127 dB without distortion, as well as a low-cut filter for regulating the development of low-frequency material. Whether employed for broadcast, stage, or studio applications, the U 87 Ai has the sought-after beauty, sound, and reputation of a real classic.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">The Gold Standard</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The Neumann U 87 Ai is maybe the most well-known and widely used studio microphone in the world. Its exquisite external design is as well known for its smooth and refined sound as it is for its smooth and refined sound. The U 87 Ai is the industry standard for speech and singing. Its three polar patterns, as well as pad and low-cut choices, allow it to be used in a variety of applications.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Omnipresent and Special</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The Neumann U 87 Ai is a magnificent work of art. It was introduced in 1967 and has influenced the sound of innumerable successful recordings over the last 50 years. When those tunes were revealed on the radio, many a DJ sat down in front of a U 87 Ai. The U 87 Ai is a large-diaphragm condenser microphone at its finest. Its tapering form and classic appearance have become part of popular cultureâ€”this is how a studio microphone appears. The same can be said for its sound; the U 87 Ai embodies studio quality and has become the gold standard against which other microphones are judged. The U 87 Ai is distinguished by its unique blend of linearity and personality. Although the U 87 Ai's on-axis frequency response is very flat, it does have a certain personality that makes it both adaptable and readily recognized.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">100% Authentic German</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The Neumann U 87 Ai Set is made of 100% Authentic German technology. Technically, the U 87 Ai is a conventional design with a timeless formula that hasn't altered in decades. The U 87 Ai employs the same dual-diaphragm condenser capsule architecture as its forefather, the renowned U 67 of the early 1960s. Its head amplifier, like its tube-driven predecessor, is founded on the same design ideas, but the U 87 Ai executes them with a FET circuit with a minimum signal path and a transformer-balanced output, assuring maximum signal integrity and good common-mode rejection.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Versatile Applications</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">As a consequence, the studio microphone has unrivaled clarity. The U 87 Ai's natural sound and middle presence make it the perfect vocal microphone, lauded by singers and engineers alike, as well as the top option for speech applications including voice-over, dubbing, and audiobooks. The U 87 Ai is a flexible microphone for everything from acoustic guitar to drum overheads due to its balanced response in each of its three directional patterns. It is frequently found in front of the bass and guitar cabinets because of its robust bass response and good midrange detail. The U 87 Ai is widely used as a spot mic for soloists, such as cello, in classical recordings. Many engineers favor a stereo pair of U 87 Ai microphones for recording piano in practically any genre, from pop and jazz to classical.<br> The Neumann U 87 Ai Set Large-Diaphragm Condenser Microphone has no warranty.</p>","specifications":[{"heading":"Basic Information","values":[{"key":"Microphone Type","value":"Condenser"},{"key":"Includes","value":"Shock Mount, Windscreen, Wood Box"},{"key":"Noise/Signal","value":"82dB (cardioid), 79dB (omni), 80dB (figure-8)"}]},{"heading":"Main Specs","values":[{"key":"Output Impedance","value":"200 ohms"},{"key":"Dimension","value":"Diaphragm Size:"},{"key":"Weight","value":"1.1 lbs"},{"key":"Polar pattern","value":"Cardioid, Omni, Figure-8"},{"key":"Connector","value":"XLR"}]},{"heading":"Compatibility","values":[{"key":"Audio recorders","value":"Yes"}]},{"heading":"Warranty","values":[{"key":"Warranty","value":"No Warranty"}]}],"latest_price":{"heading":"What is the price of Neumann U 87 Ai Set Large-Diaphragm Condenser Microphone in Bangladesh?","paragraph":"The latest price of Neumann U 87 Ai Set Large-Diaphragm Condenser Microphone in Bangladesh is 370,000৳.

Its dynamic element employs a neodymium magnet for strong output without requiring excessive preamp gain and has a frequency response of 75 Hz to 18 kHz. With a little hump at 200 Hz and a moderate increase from 4 to 10 kHz, the resulting tone is smooth and distinct. The cardioid polar pattern excels in rejecting sound at its off-axis spots, resulting in improved feedback immunity. The balanced, low-impedance output and minimal handling noise maintain signal integrity, while the all-metal design is sturdy enough for touring. The gold-plated XLR 3-pin output of the M1 assures strong conductivity and compatibility with the majority of microphone preamps. It comes with a microphone clip as well as a padded zip pouch. </p><h2>Buy RODE M1 Live Performance Dynamic Microphone from Star Tech</h2><p>In Bangladesh, you can get original <strong>RODE M1 Live Performance Dynamic Microphone</strong> From Star Tech.
