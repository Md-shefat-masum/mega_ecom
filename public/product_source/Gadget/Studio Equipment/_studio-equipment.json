It has a 6.5-inch woofer and a 1-inch tweeter with a waveguide that can create frequencies up to 30 kHz and is capable of up to 95W of total power. The XLR and 1/4\" TRS inputs of the HS7 accept balanced or unbalanced signals and can be integrated into a number of studio settings.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Low Resonance Enclosure Design</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The Yamaha HS7 Powered Studio Monitor is designed to eliminate unwanted resonance and increase the accuracy of sound reproduction to their extreme limit. The enclosures are constructed from a dense MDF with a damped acoustic response. HS Series engineers also employed a traditional three-way mitered-joint technique. Common to architectural design, this construction firmly anchors the corners of the enclosure to improve durability and eliminate unwanted resonance that can influence overall sound.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Noise Reduction Technology</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The Yamaha HS7 Powered Studio Monitor port design can greatly influence the clarity of overall sound. Often a vortex at either end of the port can generate air vibrations inside of the port, causing unwanted noise. By adopting a noise reduction technology that incorporates an analysis of a visual representation of the sound, Yamaha's engineers are able to control and reduce the vortex. Through this analysis, Yamaha has arrived at a port design that reduces noise up to 6 dB.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Controls and Connectivity</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">Full-range versions from the HS Series are equipped with two response controls, each of which has a range of settings that let them adjust to the surface acoustics of variously shaped and sized rooms. While HIGH TRIM offers more flexible control of the high-frequency response, ROOM CONTROL helps you to reduce the artificial, accentuated low-end that can frequently happen when speakers are placed adjacent to walls. HS full-range speakers may accept many balanced and unbalanced sources as inputs, including mixers, keyboards, and audio interfaces with XLR and TRS phone connectors.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify; \">High-Performance Amp</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The Yamaha HS7 Powered Studio Monitor speakers employ an amplifier unit perfectly matched to the transducers utilized in each model of the series. Featuring a bi-amp design with a separate dedicated amp for both the woofer and the tweeter, this amplifier unit ensures that each HS Series speaker consistently delivers high-resolution sound with an exceptionally flat response across the sound spectrum. The HS7 features a power stage supplying the woofer and a 35W power stage supplying the tweeter.</p><h2 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Buy Yamaha HS7 6.5\" Powered Studio Monitor Speaker from the best Studio Monitor Shop in BD</h2><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">In Bangladesh, you can get original <a href=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/yamaha-hs7-powered-studio-monitor-speaker\" target=\"\">Yamaha HS7 6.5\" Powered Studio Monitor Speaker</a> From Star Tech.

Unlocking the ability to record at standard CD quality or high-fidelity resolutions, the 24-bit / 192 kHz AD/DA converters ensure that signals are captured and reproduced with detail and accuracy.

Furthermore, the cardioid polar pattern concentrates audio capture in front of the microphone, picking up less sound from the back and sides for a cleaner, clearer vocal sound.  </p><img src=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/image/catalog/microphone/rode/x-xdm/xdm-100-001.jpg\" alt=\"RODE X XDM-100 Dynamic USB-C Microphone\" width=\"920\" height=\"450\"><h3>Plug-and-Play USB-C Connectivity</h3><p>The XDM-100 incorporates Rode's ultralow-noise, high-gain Revolution preamp, which is powered by the USB-C bus connection and ensures a stable signal level for the built-in 24-bit / 48 kHz analog to digital converter.A zero-latency 3.5mm headphone port with volume control and a mic mute button allows you to monitor your audio in real time and hear what the mic capsule is picking up.</p><h3>Complete Control of Your Audio</h3><p>The accompanying UNIFY software allows you to control all of your audio inputs and outputs from one simple mixer. Even with the most sophisticated streaming or gaming settings, the intuitive software takes seconds to set up and is extremely simple to use, allowing you to go live with excellent audio in seconds. You can combine up to four microphones and six virtual audio devices, such as your game, chat, music, system, and browser.</p><h3>Craft Your Signature Sound</h3><p>With powerful APHEX processing, including the famed Aural Exciter and Big Bottom, you can tailor the XDM-100's sound signature to your voice. Using a compressor, noise gate, and high-pass filter, you can remove background noise and make your music seem smooth, detailed, and punchy. Fine-tune each processor to perfection with granular control, just like professional audio mixing software. When using UNIFY with a Rode X microphone, all audio processing is managed by a strong DSP chip inside the microphone, which relieves the stress on your CPU and allows you to hear everything as it happens in your headphones.</p><img src=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/image/catalog/microphone/rode/x-xdm/xdm-100-002.jpg\" alt=\"RODE X XDM-100 Dynamic USB-C Microphone\" width=\"920\" height=\"450\"><h2>Buy RODE X XDM-100 Dynamic USB-C Microphone from Star Tech</h2><p>In Bangladesh, you can get original <strong>RODE X XDM-100 Dynamic USB-C Microphone</strong> From Star Tech.

The Volt 276 has first-rate analog circuitry as well as class-leading 24-bit/192kHz AD/DA conversion, allowing you to produce professional-sounding music productions, live streaming, and podcasts. This bus-powered audio interface has two microphone preamplifiers, switchable 610-style analog sound, and input metering. The crown gem of this interface, however, is its built-in 1176-derived FET compressor with three push-button application modes. Aside from that, dual analog outputs and a headphones output make monitoring a breeze, and direct monitoring is available for zero-latency operation. In addition, you have MIDI I/O for your synthesizers and controllers. The Volt 276 vaunts a rugged, retro-inspired industrial design and comes with a cutting-edge native software bundle.</p><h2 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Armed with class-leading AD/DA conversion</h2><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The Universal Audio Volt 276 has excellent AD/DA conversion, which is a must-have feature for professional-sounding recordings.

Sweetwater experts have discovered that projects produced with this USB-C audio interface are completely top-notch. You'll be able to make rock-solid, album-worthy tunes with the Volt 276 in your studio.</p><h2 style=\"text-align: justify; \">Infuses your tracks with 610-style analog sound</h2><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><div>UA is known for its traditional analog designs, and Volt 276 exemplifies that expertise. This audio interface has two analog mic/line preamplifiers that sound uncannily identical to Universal Audio's famous 610 tube preamplifier. The Vintage Preamp Mode on the Volt 276 uses skillfully built op-amps and solid-state circuitry to provide tube-like dynamic saturation and clipping, giving you strong, intuitive tone shaping for your microphones and line-level inputs. The best part is that Vintage Preamp Mode is configurable, allowing you to use the Volt 276 with external preamps and channel strips without adding coloring.</div><div><h2>Includes a real-deal 1176-derived FET compressor</h2></div><div><div>The UREI 1176 is a classic pro studio workhorse that can add punch and presence to everything from drums to guitars to voices.

The compressor on the Volt 276 has three simple push-button modes for Vocals, Guitars, and Fast sources (the latter is designed specifically for drumming), providing appropriate settings for every source.

It is capable of up to 70W of total output and features a 5-inch woofer and a 1-inch tweeter with waveguide that can produce frequencies up to 30kHz. The HS5 has both an XLR and 1/4\" TRS input that accept either balanced or unbalanced signals for integration into a variety of studio setups. The speakers are designed to eliminate unwanted resonance and increase the accuracy of sound reproduction to their extreme limit. The enclosures are constructed from a dense MDF with a damped acoustic response. HS Series engineers also employed a traditional three-way mitered-joint technique. Common to architectural design, this construction firmly anchors the corners of the enclosure to improve durability and eliminate unwanted resonance that can influence overall sound. Speaker port design can greatly influence the clarity of overall sound. Often a vortex at the either end of the port can generate air vibrations inside of the port, causing unwanted noise. By adopting a noise reduction technology that incorporates an analysis of a visual representation of the sound, Yamaha's engineers are able to control and reduce the vortex. Through this analysis Yamaha has arrived at a port design that reduces noise up to 6dB. The Yamaha HS5 5\" Speaker feature two response controls with settings that allow them to adapt to the surface acoustics of rooms of varying shape and size. ROOM CONTROL allows you to attenuate the unnatural, exaggerated low-end that can often occur when speakers are placed next to walls, while HIGH TRIM allows for more flexible control of high frequency response. For inputs, HS full-range speakers can accommodate a range of balanced and unbalanced sources such as mixers, keyboards and audio interfaces with XLR and TRS phone jacks.<br></p>","specifications":[{"heading":"Main Features","values":[{"key":"Input Sensitivity","value":"-10 dBu"},{"key":"Resistance","value":"4 Ohms"},{"key":"Frequency response","value":"74 Hz to 24 kHz (at -3 dB)"},{"key":"Drivers","value":"LF Driver: 1 x 5\" / 12.7 cm Cone"}]},{"heading":"Physical Spec","values":[{"key":"Dimension","value":"17 x 28.5 x 22.2 cm"},{"key":"Weight","value":"5.3 kg"},{"key":"Wired","value":"Yes"},{"key":"Input Connetor","value":"1 x XLR Balanced Female Analog Input (10 Kilohms)"}]},{"heading":"Power Source","values":[{"key":"Power","value":"Power Consumption: 45 W"}]},{"heading":"Warranty","values":[{"key":"Manufacturing Warranty","value":"No Warranty"}]}],"latest_price":{"heading":"What is the price of Yamaha HS5 5\" Speaker in Bangladesh?","paragraph":"The latest price of Yamaha HS5 5\" Speaker in Bangladesh is 56,000৳.

This allows you to hear the â€œairâ€� and the greater sense of space that is characteristic of audiophile recordings. The R65 studio monitor's transparent and highly accurate sound makes it ideal for use in both commercial and home recording studios as well as broadcast and post-production environments. In order to dampen resonance peaks at higher frequencies, conventional dome tweeters are injected with fluid to raise their mass, sacrificing transient response time. By contrast, the custom-designed AMT tweeter in the PreSonus R65 6.5\" Speaker uses an incredibly thin, folded Kapton membrane (&lt; 0.01 mm) with an inlayed aluminum circuit functioning as the voice coil, allowing the tweeter to move at the same instant as the electric current. The resulting reactive response time provides marked clarity and superior transient reproduction. An unfolded AMT tweeter diaphragm provides 8 to 13 times the projection area of a traditional 1-inch dome tweeter, enabling PreSonus R65 6.5\" Speakers to provide a much wider stereo soundstage than traditional designs. At the same time, the PreSonus R65 6.5\" Speaker design provides a very limited vertical dispersion, which helps to reduce reflections from the ceiling and desktop that can cause phase coherence issues. Because itâ€™s less subject to room-anomaly interference, the PreSonus R65 6.5\" Speaker reacts predictably and sounds consistent from room to room. The PreSonus R65 6.5\" Speaker utilizes a 6.5-inch, woven composite, low-frequency driver. This rigid cone maintains a more consistent dispersion pattern across its frequency response range. Biamped and driven by a 150W Class D amplifierâ€”making the R-series speakers some of the most powerful studio monitors in their categoryâ€”these monitors deliver an open, clear, and less fatiguing listening experience. You can customize the PreSonus R65 6.5\" Speaker in several ways. Itâ€™s available with black or blue faceplates to fit your studio dÃ©cor. With balanced XLR, balanced Â¼â€� TRS, and unbalanced RCA line-level inputs, itâ€™s easy to feed audio to your PreSonus R65 6.5\" Speaker from a mixer, an interface, a media player, or almost any other line-level source. And R-series studio monitors offer user-adjustable contour features for optimizing the monitors for your mixing space. This enables full integration into any studio environment. The PreSonus R65 6.5\" Speaker's design provides lifelike sonic reproduction that will allow you to hear the room in your recordings. Its transparent sound and responsive transient reproduction makes it an ideal solution for anyone who is mixing high-resolution audio.

The high SPL value of 144 dB of the capsule enables the clear and distortion-free recording of powerful sound sources like as percussion, drums, amplifiers, and other instruments. The TLM 102 offers a smooth vocal presence while avoiding overt sibilance thanks to its 8 to 12 kHz treble boost. As opposed to most other polar responses, the mic's cardioid polar pattern produces directed sound pickup in front of the capsule and strong rejection behavior behind it, producing less background noise. Although extra pop filters are available for even greater control, the inbuilt pop shield suppresses breath sounds and voice plosives. The transformerless output stage of the TLM 102 provides resistance to electromagnetic interference while assisting the mic in producing a clear character with lots of bass reach.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Silky Tone</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The TLM 102 was created by Neumann as a versatile tool for voice and instrumental recordings. The vital 8–12 kHz range, which is highlighted by its precisely tuned sound signature, is particularly important for human voices. The voice is given a regal presence in the overall mix, and the recordings acquire the smooth grace typical of large-diaphragm microphones. Despite this, the TLM 102 maintains its user-friendliness and handles difficult consonants or sibilants expertly because of the built-in pop shield.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">No Problem with High Volume</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Neumann TLM 102 handles abrupt dynamics changes and high loudness changes without distortion. Because of this, it's a great option for drums and powerful amps. It reproduces sound pressure levels of up to 144 dB (such as a very loud trumpet at a distance of roughly 4\") with excellent clarity: wide open, with strong bass and polished treble.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Neumann Sound on a Budget</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Neumann TLM 102 represents world-class audio on a tight budget. Neumann reorganized the manufacturing process and eliminated non-essential features including pattern, pad, and low-cut switches. You'll notice what they didn't leave out the moment you hear the TLM 102: the Neumann sound, which stays true to its major inspirations.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Clear and Powerful</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The TLM series utilizes a transformerless output stage to provide a strong bass transmission all the way down to the lowest frequencies as well as a clear and direct sound that is extremely \"close\" to the acoustic source. The microphone is also robust to electromagnetic fields and lowers transmission losses thanks to its transformer-free output stage.</p><h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit;\">Buy </span>Neumann TLM 102 Large-Diaphragm Cardioid Condenser Studio Microphone<span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit;\">&nbsp;from Star Tech</span><br></h2><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">In Bangladesh, you can get the original&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/neumann-tlm-102-condenser-studio-microphone\" target=\"\">Neumann TLM 102 Large-Diaphragm Cardioid Condenser Studio Microphone</a>&nbsp;from Star Tech.

The mic's compact body is ideal for positioning it in tight spots such as over a snare, inside a kick drum, or in front of a small guitar amp. By utilizing a cardioid polar pattern, the mic can effectively reduce ambient noise or instrument bleed behind the mic. The TLM 103 comes with a secure, space-saving swivel mount and a wooden box.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Affordable Alternative to the U 87</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The TLM 103, which was first offered in 1997 as a less expensive replacement for the renowned U 87, has subsequently earned a place in the annals of design history. Today, the TLM 103 serves as the benchmark for evaluating modern studio microphones. The TLM 103 has a distinctly Neumann appearance because to its conventional, tapered head grille design.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Large-Diaphragm Capsule</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Neumann TLM 103 is a cardioid microphone with a large-diaphragm condenser capsule derived from the classic K67/87 capsule of the legendary Neumann U 87. However, the TLM 103 has a slightly more modern voicing with a wide presence boost for frequencies above 5 kHz.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Refined and Full Sound</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Its highly direct yet polished tone is ideal for singers and solo instruments that effortlessly stand out in the mix. The TLM 103, of course, also features the renowned authoritative midrange that has become the distinguishing feature of Neumann microphones and elevated them to a top option in studios all over the world. The TLM 103's remarkably deep yet controlled bottom end is one of its unique features; it is ideal for sonorous vocals and strong bass instruments.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Technical Excellence</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The TLM 103 is one of the quietest microphones on the market with an extraordinarily low self-noise of only 7 dBA. Additionally, even with low-cost preamps, audio interfaces, or old tube equipment, its exceptional sensitivity of -32.5 dBV guarantees extremely low noise. The TLM 103 can manage extremely high sound pressure levels of up to 138 dB simultaneously without the need for pre attenuation. The TLM 103 is a highly simple-to-use studio microphone because of its wide dynamic range of 131 dB, which can catch anything from a gentle whisper to a thunderous bass drum without introducing noise or distortion.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Transformerless Output</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The TLM 103 is a part of Neumann's TLM series and utilizes a transformerless output stage, minimizing transmission losses and guaranteeing a highly immediate, uncolored sound that is faithful to the original as well as a clear, strong bass response, even at the highest signal levels.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Applications</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Neumann TLM 103 was initially intended for project studios and broadcast use, but because of its exceptional performance, it was quickly adopted by prestigious studios as a more contemporary-sounding substitute for the U 87 for speech, vocals, drums, guitar amps, and piano. When recording cello and double bass in classical music, the TLM 103 is frequently utilized as a spot mic.</p><h2 style=\"\">Buy Neumann TLM 103 Large-Diaphragm Cardioid Condenser Studio Microphone from Star Tech</h2><p>In Bangladesh, you can get the original&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/neumann-tlm-103-condenser-studio-microphone\" target=\"\">Neumann TLM 103 Large-Diaphragm Cardioid Condenser Studio Microphone</a>&nbsp;from Star Tech.

The TLM 107's dual-diaphragm capsule, which was specially designed for it, provides a balanced tone that is constant across its five selectable polar patterns, making it an excellent choice for the uncolored recording of vocals and instruments. Changes to the polar pattern, pad (-6 or -12 dB), and low-cut filter (40 or 100 Hz) are made using a single control on the mic's back. The TLM 107 can be used with sound sources up to 153 dB when the -12 dB pad is engaged, making it possible to record percussion, drums, amplifiers, and other loud instruments without distortion. A treble boost above 8 kHz helps the mic maintain detail and articulation while avoiding pronounced sibilance. Thanks in part to the transformerless circuitry, the TLM 107 yields only 10 dBA of self-noise, further enhancing its transparent nature.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Pro-Level Accuracy for Home Studios</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">True high-definition sound quality is available at a reasonable cost with the Neumann TLM 107. This microphone was created by Neumann for project and home studio users who desire to record an uncolored sound picture that is faithful to the original source in order to maintain all post-processing and mixing possibilities. The TLM 107, on the other hand, has all the adaptability needed to produce a high-quality recording of any source in any circumstance.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Updated Looks and Controls</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The TLM 107 was given a modern makeover by Neumann, despite the fact that its broad, tapering headgrille resembles renowned Neumann designs from the past, such the M 49 tube microphone. In addition to controlling the low-cut filter (linear, 40 Hz, or 100 Hz) and polar patterns (omnidirectional, wide cardioid, cardioid, hypercardioid, or figure-8), the sleek navigation toggle on the back of the microphone is a delight to use.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dual-Diaphragm Capsule</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The newly developed dual-diaphragm condenser capsule is specially designed for the TLM 107 to offer an outstanding transient response and an extended, carefully balanced frequency response for all polar patterns. This means you can adjust the directional pattern according to the recording situation without affecting the overall sound balance, which is quite uncommon for a large-diaphragm microphone.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Neumann Engineering</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The TLM 107 is a part of Neumann's TLM series and uses a transformerless circuit to function, guaranteeing an open, transparent sound and a complete, unconstrained bass transmission even at maximum volume. To lessen rumbling and account for the proximity impact during close-miking, there are two low-cut options available. The TLM 107 can tolerate extremely high sound pressure levels of up to 141 dB without clipping (up to 153 dB with attenuation) even without using the two-pad settings. An extremely quiet recording studio's background noise is substantially louder than the TLM 107's self-noise, which is just 10 dBA. In other words, the TLM 107 won't amplify undesired distortion or add noise to your recordings.</p><h2><span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; text-align: justify;\">Buy&nbsp;</span><span style=\"text-align: justify;\">Neumann TLM 107 Large-Diaphragm Cardioid Condenser Studio Microphone<span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit;\">&nbsp;from Star Tech</span></span><br></h2><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">In Bangladesh, you can get the original&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.startech.com.bd/neumann-tlm-107-condenser-studio-microphone\" target=\"\">Neumann TLM 107 Large-Diaphragm Cardioid Condenser Studio Microphone</a>&nbsp;from Star Tech.

A completely interactive user interface combined with a fluid workflow guarantees instant familiarity and confidence. This completely changes the game with its exceptional sound performance at a remarkably low cost, thanks to careful design and advanced engineering.&nbsp;The X32 Digital Mixer family is the product of the famed console manufacturer Midas' engineering, production, and application skills, the renowned signal processing wizardry of Klark Teknik, and Behringer's exceptional ability to provide an exceptional value proposition. The X32 is deeply rooted in the cooperation among these three outstanding companies. X32 elevates the standard for what a digital mixer can be, starting with the immaculate mic preamps built by Midas, going all the way to Klark Teknik's rock-solid, ultra-low-latency SuperMAC networking technology and Behringer's newly redesigned processing algorithms. Our unwavering dedication to providing cutting-edge technology, unparalleled usability, and genuine roadworthiness has allowed us to design a digital console that is the perfect medium for expressing your creativity.</p><h3>Multi-Channel Networking and Improved Workflow</h3><p>Behringer X32 Digital Mixer Console significantly improved the workflow and included brand-new features, such as \"Acoustic Integration\" for complete connectivity and control of your speaker and In-Ear Monitor (IEM) systems, with the release of our new X32 version 2.0 firmware. Next, we incorporated vintage processor samples based on \"true physical modeling\" and entirely redesigned the more than 50 onboard FX \"plug-ins.\" In addition to the onboard ULTRANET and AES50 connectivity, we've further increased the flexibility of the X32 by including swappable expansion cards that allow it to be connected to additional multi-channel audio networking via USB, ADAT, MADI, and Dante protocols. Above all, the X32 gives you unrestricted access to digital power. </p><h3>29 Programmable LCD Scribble Strips</h3><p>The automated control surface of X32 is made to show you the control you require at the appropriate time. A total of 29 programmable LCD Scribble Strips provide bus/channel identification that corresponds to the controlled object. Use them to add instantly recognizable icons and input/output tags. Next, combine related inputs visually using color to enable quick, on-the-spot detection. It's sleek, simple, and efficient—plus, you won't ever need masking tape again. </p><h3>Daylight Viewable 7-Inch Display</h3><p>The 7-inch color TFT (Thin-Film Transistor) display on the X32 console allows you to check the configuration parameters at any time.&nbsp;TFT is perfect for concert and outdoor festival events because of its strong contrast performance and outdoor visibility. Surrounded by highly accurate, context-aware tactile encoders, the screen activates and instantly displays in vivid detail any modifications made to an extensive array of parameters. With just one or two button taps, users can easily handle essential operations like effects, metering, routing, and much more thanks to intelligent design.</p><h2>Buy Behringer X32 40 Channel Digital Mixer Console From Star Tech</h2><p>In Bangladesh, you can get original <strong>Behringer X32 40 Channel Digital Mixer Console</strong> From Star Tech.

Regardless of your familiarity with digital mixers, the M32's user-friendly interface provides a seamless mixing experience that makes you feel right at home. The workflow removes barriers, diversion, and hesitancy from the very beginning of usage. The M32 Channel Strip consolidates the most crucial channel processing parameters into a single strip, ensuring that the controls remain consistent regardless of the channel you are utilizing. This incredibly effective design is the result of decades of console design experience at MIDAS as well as user feedback. From any viewing position, optimal control illumination guarantees a clear indication of levels or conditions. You may adjust the preamp settings, frequency shelving, dual dynamics sections, multi-mode fully parametric EQ, bus sends, main, mono, and stereo panning, and more with illuminated rotary encoders and switches. On the M32, there are eleven well-positioned view buttons that correspond to different features. These buttons allow you to quickly get details about that particular function. For example, when you click the View button in the Equalizer section, the main display immediately displays the EQ information for that channel, allowing you to change all associated parameters in detail. A few user-definable controls are available on several digital consoles, but the Assign portion of the M32 sets a new benchmark with 36 fully customizable options spread across three levels.</p><h3>Industry-First 192 kHz Accuracy</h3><p>The M32 console is a breakthrough mid-format live console that combines industry-leading 192 kHz ADC and DAC converters, a future-proof floating point audio engine, an incredibly low-latency design, and legendary Midas sound quality with cutting-edge digital technology. The incredibly elegant design of the M32 provides an incredibly opulent mixing experience. Exquisite building materials, such as carbon fiber, offer unmatched strength and durability in addition to being far lighter than similar consoles. Award-winning Midas PRO Series microphone preamplifiers and specially created Midas PRO motorized faders, rated for one million life cycles, three times longer than those of rival top consoles are used in the M32. The Midas M32 is a cutting-edge console that sets the standard for live mixing very high.</p><h3>Legendary MIDAS Audio Quality</h3><p>For engineers and performers, it matters most that the MIDAS M32 design and construction will undoubtedly draw attention. And that's where the M32 really shines; it comes from a renowned pedigree that essentially sets the standard in electrical design and sound quality, making it the newest in a long series of immaculate-sounding MIDAS consoles. Since groups like Billy Joel, Yes, The Beach Boys, Pink Floyd, and others brought MIDAS consoles to prominence forty years ago, the MIDAS tradition has always been about unwavering quality and the best possible sound reproduction. Audiophile Cirrus Logic multi-channel, 192 kHz-capable A/D converters with a 114 dB dynamic range provide remarkably low distortion and low noise performance, supporting the analog input section.</p><h3>Daylight Viewable 7-Inch Display Screen</h3><p>The 7-inch full-color, day-viewable TFT (Thin-Film Transistor) display on the M32 provides the necessary configuration parameters at the appropriate time. TFT is perfect for concert and outdoor festival events because of its strong contrast performance and outdoor visibility. Surrounded by highly accurate, context-aware tactile encoders, the screen activates and instantly displays in vivid detail any modifications made to an extensive array of parameters. With just one or two button taps, users can easily handle essential operations like effects, metering, routing, and much more thanks to the intelligent design.</p><h3>All channel/bus EQs have a 100-band RTA</h3><p>Showcasing spectrograph views and a complete bar, the M32-EDIT control application offers a 100-band real-time analyzer (RTA). This high-resolution RTA captures a full 10-second sonogram window and shows the audio energy distribution over time in 100 frequency bands. You can alternate between the combined view, which places the RTA view above the channel and bus EQ curves, and the big RTA view, which shows any available signal at full screen resolution. This tool allows you to directly view the audio spectrum as a result of your filtering selections. Furthermore, the RTA can be positioned above the FX rack's 31-band graphic EQs. Frequency management and monitoring have never been simpler! </p><h2>Buy Midas M32 40 Channel Digital Mixer Console From Star Tech</h2><p>In Bangladesh, you can get original <strong>Midas M32 40 Channel Digital Mixer Console</strong> From Star Tech.

With a little hump at 200 Hz and a moderate increase from 4 to 10 kHz, the resulting tone is smooth and distinct. The cardioid polar pattern excels in rejecting sound at its off-axis spots, resulting in improved feedback immunity. The balanced, low-impedance output and minimal handling noise maintain signal integrity, while the all-metal design is sturdy enough for touring. The gold-plated XLR 3-pin output of the M1 assures strong conductivity and compatibility with the majority of microphone preamps.

It contains 40 mm speakers that provide a wide frequency range of 18 - 20000 Hz, ensuring balanced and precise sound reproduction. It has a sensitivity of 110 dB SPL/V @ 1 kHz and an impedance of 32 ohms, making it suitable for most audio devices and sources. It has a maximum input power of 200 mW, which implies it can tolerate high volume levels without distortion. The AKG K52 is lightweight and durable, featuring a self-adjusting headband and soft ear pillows that give a snug and pleasant fit. It includes a 2.5-meter cable that allows for considerable mobility and flexibility. It also contains a 3.5 mm jack plug and a 6.3 mm screw-on adapter for connecting to various devices and equipment. The AKG K52 is ideal for studio mixing, monitoring, and hi-fi listening because it produces a realistic, accurate sound that allows you to hear every nuance and detail of your music. The AKG K52's sound quality and comfort will appeal to musicians, producers, and audiophiles alike.</p><h3>Professional Drivers</h3><p>The AKG K52 headphones provide strong, kept low-frequency response, giving kick drums and bass guitar clarity. At the same time, the delicacy in singers, guitars, and acoustic instruments is revealed by the detailed yet finely balanced high-frequency response. Its large 40mm drivers provide great sensitivity for strong output, as well as an extended frequency response that displays every detail. The K52s also have a low-impedance construction that makes them compatible with a wide range of playback devices, from professional studio equipment to portable music players.</p><h3>Closed-back Design</h3><p>The closed-back design of the K52 headphones reduces audio leakage and directs sound directly to your ears. You won't hear the drummer drop his sticks in the middle of tracking, and the click track won't be picked up by the mic in your headphones. The redesigned acoustic chamber that lies between the ear cup and the hinge that attaches to the headband is responsible for the outstanding level of audio isolation. The revolutionary design of AKG allows you to rotate your head in any direction without letting sound in or out. No matter where you choose to create, the K52 will provide you with a private workplace.</p><h3>The Style That Fits All</h3><p>Tracking the same portion for hours on end to get the ideal take is when comfort comes into play. AKG created their innovative self-adjusting headband to automatically produce the optimal fit for each band member. There's no need to worry with sensitive sizing systems that may fail over time. The open headband keeps the K52 headphones light and comfortable without sacrificing driver size. Breathable, lightweight ear cushions wrap your ears rather than placing pressure on them. A single-sided cable also allows you to move around freely. To summarize, these high-performance headphones sound, feel, and look fantastic.</p><h2>Buy AKG K52 Professional Closed Back Studio Monitor Headphone from Star Tech</h2><p>In Bangladesh, you can get original <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">AKG K52 Professional Closed Back Studio Monitor Headphone</span> From Star Tech.

The sound quality of the JBL LSR305 5\" Speaker is exquisite and gives the most accurate of sound output. The Image Control Waveguide was developed for JBLâ€™s new flagship M2 Master Reference Monitor and with the introduction of the JBL 3 Series, is now included for the first time in an affordable, compact reference monitor. The patent-pending design of the Image Control Waveguide precisely controls the sound emanating from  the speaker in the vertical and horizontal planes ensuring the presentation at the listening position is neutral  and accurate. The 3 Series long-throw woofer and its damped woven composite Neodymium tweeter are designed from the ground up to reproduce the powerful transients and micro dynamics of your mix. These drivers deliver impressive deep bass and smooth high frequency response beyond the range of human hearing. JBLâ€™s Patented Slip Stream low frequency port design works in concert with the woofer to produce deep bass response at all playback levels. The double-flared shape of the port is precisely engineered for greater low-frequency extension and reduced turbulence. 3 Series efficient Class D Amplifiers provide abundant power to deliver the output and dynamic headroom needed for the most demanding production styles. Balanced XLR and 6 mm TRS inputs give you the options you need to connect your 3 Series to any signal source while maintaining professional signal quality. The -10 dB/+4 dB sensitivity switch ensures compatibility with a broad range of signal sources, allowing you to connect the 3 Series to high output professional gear without any danger of input overload. LF Trim and HF Trim â€œTRIMâ€� switches for both the Low and High Frequencies give you excellent control over the 3 Series sound in â€œyourâ€� room. Use these to fine-tune the amount of bass and treble you hear to compensate for room acoustics, program material and your personal taste. Prior to becoming a production-ready design, each 3 Series model is subjected to JBLâ€™s tough 100 hour power test, in which the speaker is required to play continually at full output for 100 hours without failure. This demanding test ensures your 3 Series speakers will deliver years of reliable performance. While most manufacturers take only a single on axis measurement of the speakerâ€™s performance, this doesnâ€™t tell how it will sound in your room. JBLâ€™s LSR Linear Spatial Reference design criteria requires seventy-two measurements yielding more than 1,200 times more data, enabling JBL to engineer a speaker that â€œsounds rightâ€� in any working space. With LSR design, 3 Series Studio Monitors deliver superior accuracy regardless of the size and shape of your room, so your mixes â€œhit their markâ€� when heard on any playback system. <br></p>","specifications":[{"heading":"Main Features","values":[{"key":"Signal / noise ratio","value":"108 dB SPL C-Weighted"},{"key":"Input Sensitivity","value":"-10 dB/+4 dB"},{"key":"Frequency response","value":"43 Hz-24 kHz"}]},{"heading":"Physical Spec","values":[{"key":"Dimension","value":"298 mm x 185 mm x 251 mm"},{"key":"Weight","value":"4.6 kg"},{"key":"Wired","value":"Yes"},{"key":"Input Connetor","value":"1 x XLR, 1 x TRS Balanced"}]},{"heading":"Power Source","values":[{"key":"Power","value":"100-240 VAC +/- 10% 50/60 Hz"}]},{"heading":"Warranty","values":[{"key":"Manufacturing Warranty","value":"No Warranty"}]}],"latest_price":{"heading":"What is the price of JBL LSR305 5\" Speaker in Bangladesh?","paragraph":"The latest price of JBL LSR305 5\" Speaker in Bangladesh is 36,500৳.
