Along with our previous Lamp, LED, and Laser versions, this new economical and brilliant LCD series includes up to 5000 lumens, a 50000:1 contrast ratio, signal inputs up to 3840 x 2160 (4K) @ 30Hz, and weighs just 3.3kg, making it exceptionally simple to move about your house, business, or anyplace. The latest display technology! Display content from your Windows laptop or computer via the USB-C or USB-A port with a USB cable to the projector. Connect your projector and Windows device to the same local area network and use the network to send source content to the projector and onto the large screen. When no network is available, we also provide the option of displaying through USB to the projector's RJ45 connector via cable. The use of sophisticated Iris dynamically modifies the iris settings, offering brightness optimization to best fit the information being presented. To make the most of the projector's available light output, advanced iris darkens dark images and material and opens up on bright ones. The resultant contrast levels are fantastic.
