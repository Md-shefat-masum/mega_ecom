CPU speeds up to 3.5x faster. GPU speeds up to 5x faster. Our most advanced Neural Engine for up to 9x faster machine learning. The longest battery life ever in a MacBook Air. And a silent, fanless design. This much power has never been this ready to go.&nbsp;Itâ€™s here. Our first chip designed specifically for Mac. Packed with an astonishing 16 billion transistors, the Apple M1 system on a chip (SoC) integrates the CPU, GPU, Neural Engine, I/O, and so much more onto a single tiny chip. With incredible performance, custom technologies, and industry-leading power efficiency,1 M1 is not just a next step for Mac â€” itâ€™s another level entirely.M1 has the fastest CPU weâ€™ve ever made. With that kind of processing speed, MacBook Air can take on new extraordinarily intensive tasks like professional-quality editing and action-packed gaming. But the 8â€‘core CPU on M1 isnâ€˜t just up to 3.5x faster than the previous generation2 â€” it balances high-performance cores with efficiency cores that can still crush everyday jobs while using just a tenth of the power.Up to 7-core GPUThe GPU in M1 puts MacBook Air in a class of its own. M1 features the worldâ€˜s fastest integrated graphics in a personal computer.8 Thatâ€™s up to 5x faster graphics performance compared with the previous generation.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">Incredible graphics performanceMacBook Air can take on more graphics-intensive projects than ever. For the first time, content creators can edit and seamlessly play back multiple streams of fullâ€‘quality 4K video without dropping a frame.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">Apps on MacBook Air can use machine learning (ML) to automatically retouch photos like a pro, make smart tools such as magic wands and audio filters more accurate at autoâ€‘detection, and so much more. Thatâ€™s not just brain power â€” thatâ€™s the power of a full stack of ML technologies.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \">Developed to unlock the potential of the M1 chip, macOS Big Sur transforms Mac with major performance benefits and so much more. Powerful updates for apps. A beautiful new design. Industry-leading privacy features and bestâ€‘inâ€‘class security.
